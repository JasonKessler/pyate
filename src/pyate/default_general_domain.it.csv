6 ," When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts is a 2006 documentary film directed by Spike Lee about the devastation of New Orleans, Louisiana following the failure of the levees during Hurricane Katrina.  It was filmed in late August and early September 2005, and premiered at the New Orleans Arena on August 16, 2006 and was first aired on HBO the following week. The television premiere aired in two parts on August 21 and 22, 2006 on HBO. It has been described by Sheila Nevins, chief of HBO's documentary unit, as 'one of the most important films HBO has ever made.'  The title is a reference to the blues tune 'When the Levee Breaks' by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie about the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.
The documentary was screened at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31 and September 1, 2006. It won the Orizzonti Documentary Prize and one of two FIPRESCI awards. It was also shown at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival on September 15 and September 16, 2006. It won three awards at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards and received a Peabody Award.The documentary is based on news video footage and still photos of Katrina and its aftermath, interspersed with interviews. Interviewees include politicians, journalists, historians, engineers, and many residents of various parts of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, who give first hand accounts of their experiences with the levee failures and the aftermath.  The first installment opens with a photo and film montage of historic and recent New Orleans scenes, with a soundtrack of Louis Armstrong performing Louis Alter's 'Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans'. At the end of the last episode is a similar montage with Fats Domino's 'Walking to New Orleans' on the soundtrack.
The film's original score is by Terence Blanchard, a New Orleans-born trumpeter who appears in the film, with his mother and aunt, as they return to their flooded home. Not being the first time that Terence Blanchard had worked as a composer for a film by Spike Lee, Blanchard had worked to create compositions of a more universal genre of jazz as opposed to New Orleans style jazz in order to reach masses of audiences to raise awareness of the results of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. In general, the music he had composed was written under the context of respecting those who were directly affected by the catastrophe and with intentions of providing contexts to allow audiences to sympathize with those affected.In the style of Michael Apted's Up series (a documentary series that interviews Apted's subjects every seven years), Lee planned to interview his featured subjects in Levees at least once more.  In August 2010, HBO aired Lee's documentary series, If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise, which chronicles how New Orleans and the Gulf Coast area have fared in the five years following Hurricane Katrina.

26 ," The grey-cowled wood rail or grey-necked wood rail (Aramides cajaneus) is a species of bird in the family Rallidae, the rails. It lives primarily in the forests, mangroves, and swamps of Central and South America. Of the two subspecies, A. c. avicenniae is found in southeastern Brazil, while the nominate is found throughout the portion of the range not occupied by the other subspecies. The species as a whole is usually found at elevations from sea level to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft), although some have been found above that. This bird's large extent of occurrence along with its population is why it is considered to be least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In some places, it is occasionally hunted and kept for food.
This bird, large for a wood rail, has both a grey head and neck. In the nominate, the back of the head has a brown patch. The upperparts are olive-green to dark brown. The chest and flanks are a rufous colour, with the belly, rump, and tail being black. The legs are coral-red, the bill is a bright greenish-yellow, and the eyes are red. The sexes are similar. The juveniles can be differentiated by their duller look, and the chicks have a black, downy appearance, brown head, and black beak. The subspecies avicenniae can be differentiated by its smaller size, lack of a brown patch at the back of the neck, and its lower back being toned slightly olive. The underparts are also pale.
A monogamous bird, pairs can be found together throughout the year. During the breeding season, which usually lasts from March to August, the grey-cowled wood rail builds nests that can be found on flat branches and in thickets, usually at heights between 1 and 3 metres (3 and 10 ft). In these nests, there is a clutch consisting of three to seven eggs, incubated by both sexes. The chicks that hatch are precocial, able to move soon after hatching. This rail feeds on a wide range of foods, from molluscs to seeds. It is also known to feed on the feces of giant otters.

55 ," Involuntary unemployment occurs when a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage yet is unemployed. Involuntary unemployment is distinguished from voluntary unemployment, where workers choose not to work because their reservation wage is higher than the prevailing wage. In an economy with involuntary unemployment there is a surplus of labor at the current real wage. This occurs when there is some force that prevents the real wage rate from decreasing to the real wage rate that would equilibrate supply and demand (such as a minimum wage above the market-clearing wage). Structural unemployment is also involuntary.
Economists have several theories explaining the possibility of involuntary unemployment including implicit contract theory, disequilibrium theory, staggered wage setting, and efficiency wages.The officially measured unemployment rate is the ratio of involuntary unemployment to the sum of involuntary unemployment and employment (the denominator of this ratio being the total labor force).

65 ," Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is a 1971 American blaxploitation action thriller film written, co-produced, scored, edited, directed by and starring Melvin Van Peebles. His son Mario Van Peebles also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the picaresque story of the flight of a poor black man from the white police authorities.
Van Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on American cinema.
The musical score of Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song was performed by Earth, Wind & Fire. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the soundtrack album prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. Huey P. Newton celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and Sweetback became required viewing for members of the Black Panther Party. According to Variety, it demonstrated to Hollywood that films which portrayed 'militant' blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the blaxploitation genre, although critic Roger Ebert, commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an exploitation film.

The group listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled the album from the best versions. Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No. 2 in the UK album charts, ultimately selling over half a million copies. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time. "

69 ," An e-patient is a health consumer who participates fully in his/her medical care, primarily by gathering information about medical conditions that impact them and their families, using the Internet and other digital tools. The term encompasses those who seek guidance for their own ailments and the friends and family members who go online on their behalf. E-patients report two effects of their health research:  'better health information and services, and different, but not always better, relationships with their doctors.'E-patients are active in their care and demonstrate the power of the Participatory Medicine or Health 2.0 / Medicine 2.0. model of care.  The 'e' can stand for 'electronic' but has also been used to refer to other terms, such as 'equipped', 'enabled', 'empowered' and 'expert'.The current state of knowledge on the impact of e-patients on the healthcare system and the quality of care received indicates:

A growing number of people say the internet played a crucial or important role as they helped another person cope with a major illness.
Many clinicians underestimated the benefits and overestimated the risks of online health resources for patients.
Medical online support groups are an important healthcare resource.
“…the net friendliness of clinicians and provider organizations—as rated by the e-patients they serve—is becoming an important new aspect of healthcare quality.”
According to one study, the advent of patients as partners is one of the most important cultural medical revolutions of the past century.
In order to understand the impact of the e-patient, clinicians will likely need to move beyond 'pre-internet medical constructs.'
Medical education must adapt to take the e-patient into account, and to prepare students for medical practice that includes the e-patient.A 2011 study of European e-patients found that they tended to be 'inquisitive and autonomous' and that they noted that the number of e-patients in Europe appeared to be rising. A 2012 study found that e-patients uploading videos about their health experienced a loss of privacy, but also positive benefits from social support. Furthermore, a 2017 study utilizing social network analysis found that when e-patients are included in health care conferences, they increase information flow, expand propagation, and deepen engagement in the conversation of Tweets when compared to both physicians and researchers while only making up 1.4% of the stakeholder mix.Inspired by the seminal work on e-patients by Tom Ferguson and the e-Patients Scholars Working Group, Swedish patient and engineer Sara Riggare, in February 2016 coined a new Swedish word: 'spetspatient' (in English: 'lead user patient' or 'lead patient') "

72 ," Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs) and selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) formerly known as dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.
Selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) are historically and typically steroidal in structure while selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs) are typically nonsteroidal. The combined abbreviation of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist and modulator is SEGRAM.  A number of such ligands have been developed and are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical testing.
SEGRAMs achieve their selectivity by triggering only a subset the glucocorticoid receptor mechanisms of action. "

80 ," Anosmia, also known as smell blindness, is the loss of the ability to detect one or more smells. Anosmia may be temporary or permanent. It differs from hyposmia, which is a decreased sensitivity to some or all smells.Anosmia can be due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the lining of the paranasal sinus and in the middle and superior turbinates.
When anosmia is caused by inflammatory changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation. It can be caused by chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would increase intracranial pressure over a long period of time, and in some cases by ciliopathy, including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia.The term derives from the New Latin anosmia, based on Ancient Greek ἀν- (an-) + ὀσμή (osmḗ, 'smell'; another related term, hyperosmia, refers to an increased ability to smell). Some people may be anosmic for one particular odor, a condition known as 'specific anosmia'. The absence of the sense of smell from birth is known as congenital anosmia.

84 ," The pericycle is a cylinder of parenchyma or sclerenchyma cells that lies just inside the endodermis and is the outer most part of the stele of plants.
Although it is composed of non-vascular parenchyma cells, it's still considered part of the vascular cylinder because it arises from the procambium as do the vascular tissues it surrounds.
In eudicots, it also has the capacity to produce lateral roots.  Branch roots arise from this primary meristem tissue. In plants undergoing secondary growth, the pericycle contributes to the vascular cambium often diverging into a cork cambium.
In angiosperms certain molecules within the endodermis and the surrounding vasculature are sent to the pericycle which promotes the growth of the root meristems. "

It states that that for a holomorphic function f in the open unit disk that does not take the values 0 or 1, the value |f(z)| of can be bounded in terms of z and f(0).
Schottky's original theorem did not give an explicit bound for f. Ostrowski (1931, 1933) gave some weak explicit bounds. Ahlfors (1938, theorem B) gave a strong explicit bound, showing that  if f is holomorphic in the open unit disk and does not take the values 0 or 1 then

Climbing Silence took Ondra more than 4 years of practice and training visits, and long-term dedicated preparation, including extensive mental and physical training for the specific difficulties posed by the route. "

203 ," A partial capo is a type of a capo designed to capo only some of the strings of an instrument, as opposed to a standard capo which affects all strings.
A partial capo may appear to have a similar effect to alternate tunings, but there are differences. A common example is a capo which covers the top five strings of a guitar, leaving the bass E string uncapoed. When played at the second fret, this appears to create a drop D tuning (where the bass E string is tuned to a D) raised one full tone in pitch. In fact, these are often marketed as 'drop D capos'. However, this affects only the open tuning of the strings, and thus, when used at the second fret, an E chord using the 'D shape' will have the 'Drop D sound' with a low E note. However, a G-shape chord can be played as well, as the fretted E string will not be affected as it would be if the string was retuned. "

As a historian, he followed the romantic tradition. His paintings include Holy Family with Elizabeth and John 1819, Staadtische Galerie im Staadelschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt and A Visitation, Christ and the Samaritan c. 1820, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin.

Combatant commanders may designate theaters of war, theaters of operation, combat zones, and communications zones.  Joint force commanders may define additional operational areas or joint areas to assist in the coordination and execution of joint warfare. The size of these areas and the types of forces used depend on the scope, nature, and projected duration of the operation.
Combatant commanders and other joint force commanders use the following organization of the battlespace at the operational level of war.  Combatant commanders are assigned an area of responsibility in the Unified Command Plan.

Theater of war, the area of aerial, terrestrial, and naval/littoral that is, or may become, directly involved in the manner of combat; either defined by the National Command Authority or a combatant commander, This area doesn't normally encompass the combatant commander's entire area of responsibility.
Theater of operations, a sub-area within a theater of war defined by the force commander required to conduct or support specific operations. Different theaters of operations within the same theater of war will normally be geographically separate and focused on different enemy forces. Theaters of operations are usually of significant size, allowing for operations over extended periods of time.
Combat zone, areas required by combat forces for the conduct of operations.
Communication zone, the rear part of the theater of war or theater of operations (behind but contiguous to the combat zone) that contains lines of communications, establishments for supply or evacuation, and other agencies required for the immediate support and maintenance of the field forces. The Marine Corps component commander will normally focus  efforts to deploy, support, and sustain  forces, particularly the MAGTF, in the communications zone  The commander will normally locate headquarters close to the joint force commander, who usually establishes  headquarters in the communications zone.Understanding the joint battlespace at the operational level of war in which forces will operate is an important step in setting the conditions for their success. Force commanders must understand the relationship between the Area of Operation (AO), Area of Interest, and Area of Influence.
By analyzing  AO in terms of area of influence and area of interest, a force commander determines whether the assigned AO is appropriate. This analysis may include the forces’ capabilities to conduct actions across the warfighting functions. "

Etudes Boreales were composed for, and dedicated to, Jack and Jeanne Kirstein. The latter performed Cage's piano works in the 1970s, but found Etudes Boreales unplayable; the first performer to find a way to play the pieces was percussionist Michael Pugliese (Pritchett, 199).
The set comprises four pieces. The cello parts are technically similar to Freeman Etudes: they are extremely demanding pieces composed using chance operations, every aspect of the work meticulously detailed in the score. The difference between the works is that in Etudes Boreales the pitch range is limited at any given time, and changes throughout the pieces, whereas in Freeman Etudes the range was unlimited. An excerpt from one of the etudes shows that the technique required involves the ability to jump accurately to any point on the fingerboard or beyond, which is particularly difficult in these pieces as they are to be played without vibrato (Stowell, 221):

The piano parts of Etudes Boreales were composed using star charts, as in Atlas Eclipticalis, Etudes Australes and Song Books (here Cage chose the maps of Atlas Boreales, an atlas of the northern sky by Antonín Bečvář, hence the title of the work).  However, the charts were used not to determine actual pitches, as in those works, but to determine where on the piano the performer is to play (the keyboard, the frame, the strings, etc.). This effectively transforms the piano etudes into percussion works (Pritchett, 199).
Cello and piano parts may be performed separately, as Etudes Boreales for cello or Etudes Boreales for piano, or simultaneously as duets, although they were composed independently. "

398 ," In Arthurian legend, the Fisher King (French: Roi pêcheur, Welsh: Brenin Pysgotwr), also known as the Wounded King or Maimed King (Roi blessé, in Old French Roi Méhaigié, Welsh: Brenin Clwyfedig), is the last in a long bloodline charged with keeping the Holy Grail. Versions of the original story vary widely, but he is always wounded in the legs or groin and incapable of standing. All he is able to do is fish in a small boat on the river near his castle, Corbenic, and wait for some noble who might be able to heal him by asking a certain question. In later versions, knights travel from many lands to try to heal the Fisher King, but only the chosen can accomplish the feat. This is achieved by Percival alone in the earlier stories; he is joined by Galahad and Bors in the later ones.
Many later works have two wounded 'Grail Kings' who live in the same castle, a father and son (or grandfather and grandson). The more seriously wounded father stays in the castle, sustained by the Grail alone, while the more active son can meet with guests and go fishing. For the purposes of clarity in the remainder of this article, where both appear, the father will be called the Wounded King, the son named the Fisher King.
The Fisher King legends imply that he becomes unable to father or support a next generation to carry on after his death (a 'thigh' wound has been interpreted by many scholars in Arthurian literature as a genital wound). There are slight hints in the early versions that his kingdom and lands suffer as he does, and modern scholars have suggested his impotence affecting the fertility of the land and reducing it to a barren wasteland.

425 ," Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt is a book by the American writer Michael Lewis, published by W. W. Norton & Company on March 31, 2014. The book is a non-fiction investigation into the phenomenon of high-frequency trading (HFT) in the US financial market, with the author interviewing and collecting the experiences of several individuals working on Wall Street. Lewis concludes that HFT is used as a method to front run orders placed by investors. He goes further to suggest that broad technological changes and unethical trading practices have transformed the U.S. stock market from 'the world's most public, most democratic, financial market' into a 'rigged' market.The book has drawn criticism from some academics and industry experts, particularly on Lewis's grasp of HFT and other factual inaccuracies in its depiction of trading. Other critics have praised Lewis's explanations of trading concepts and concurred with his criticism of HFT; however, it is suggested that he neglects to pay attention to the larger issue of financial regulation, and had excessively simplified the relationship between various institutions in the financial market. A few executives in the industry have also responded by dismissing the book's content as 'closer to fiction'.

429 ," Pankow are a German rock band, founded in East Berlin in 1981. Their name came from the Berlin district of Pankow, which was once home to most of the officials of the East German government. The band's original lineup consisted of Jürgen Ehle, André Herzberg, Rainer Kirchmann, Jäcki Reznicek and Frank Hille. Other members were Stefan Dohanetz, Ingo York and Jens Jensen.As their lyrics often contained criticism of the East German regime, they frequently encountered problems releasing their music. 'Like many writers, they were among the established names of aesthetic subversion,' the journalist Christoph Dieckmann wrote in a 1999 article published in Rolling Stone.With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the associated open access to media outside Germany Pankow also moved briefly into the focus of the Anglo-American journalism. The U.S. historian Timothy W. Ryback, known for his 1990 published book Rock around the bloc: a history of rock music in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, characterized Pankow as one of two most prestigious and most professional groups of East Berlin's rock music scene, writing that they 'originally showed the influence of the Rolling Stones, but has developed into a dynamic band that combines the energy of the Clash with the innovation of the Talking Heads.'In the song 'Langeweile' ('Boredom'), the criticism was expressed in the words 'Seen the same country too long, heard the same language too often, waited too long, hoped too much, bowed down to the old men too often'. The song 'Paule Panke' was banned by the state-run Amiga record label, while 'Langeweile' was banned from radio airplay; however, the band performed both at every concert.Pankow has occasionally been compared with the Rolling Stones  and have implemented many musical styles and theatrical projects in their history.
On November 3, 2011, Pankow commenced a 30-year anniversary tour. "
430 ," The blastocyst is a structure formed in the early development of mammals. It possesses an inner cell mass (ICM) which subsequently forms the embryo. The outer layer of the blastocyst consists of cells collectively called the trophoblast. This layer surrounds the inner cell mass and a fluid-filled cavity known as the blastocoel. The trophoblast gives rise to the placenta. The name 'blastocyst' arises from the Greek βλαστός blastos ('a sprout') and κύστις kystis ('bladder, capsule'). In other animals this is called a blastula.
In humans, blastocyst formation begins about 5 days after fertilization when a fluid-filled cavity opens up in the morula, the early embryonic stage of a ball of 16 cells.
The blastocyst has a diameter of about 0.1–0.2 mm and comprises 200–300 cells following rapid cleavage (cell division). About seven days after fertilization, the blastocyst undergoes implantation, embedding into the endometrium of the uterine wall. There it will undergo further developmental processes, including gastrulation. Embedding of the blastocyst into the endometrium requires that it hatches from the zona pellucida, which prevents adherence to the fallopian tube as the pre-embryo makes its way to the uterus.
The use of blastocysts in in vitro fertilization (IVF) involves culturing a fertilized egg for five days before implanting it into the uterus. It can be a more viable method of fertility treatment than traditional IVF. The inner cell mass of blastocysts is the source of embryonic stem cells, which are broadly applicable in stem cell therapies including cell repair, replacement and regeneration. "

466 ," Venus Bay is a wide bay and a township on that bay on the east coast of Victoria, Australia.  At the 2016 census Venus Bay had a population of 944.
The name Venus Bay was given to the bay by a French expedition under Nicholas Baudin.  This was apparently after George Bass's trading ship the Venus. (The expedition traded with Bass in Sydney in around 1801.)
The town of Venus Bay is situated on a narrow peninsula of land located 180 km south-east of Melbourne.  Originally named Evergreen the town takes its name from the body of water on its western shore.  On the eastern side of the peninsula is Anderson's Inlet, named after the settler Samuel Anderson.
Venus Bay has become a popular holiday retreat for people from Melbourne and is close to other popular South Gippsland tourist spots such as Phillip Island and Wilsons Promontory.  The permanent population hovers just below 1,000, however this can swell into the thousands during holiday periods.  The town is split into three 'estates'.  The First Estate is home to the only shopping strip in Venus Bay, consisting of a general store, pharmacy, surf shop / hair dresser, cafe, take-away shops, real estate agents, caravan park and a restaurant.  Three of Venus Bay's five surf beaches (Nos. 1, 2 and 3 beaches) are in the First Estate, with the Venus Bay Surf Livesaving Club located at the No. 1 Beach.  This is the only patrolled beach, although during the busy summer period surf patrols regularly make their way up and down the beaches to just beyond No. 5 beach.
The Venus Bay Community Centre is also located in the First Estate and runs a variety of programs and activities and is home to the Community Recycling Op Shop. In addition, the Community Centre runs a summer holiday program for kids and organizes the Summer Beach Shuttle Bus.
The Second Estate is home to Nos. 4 and 5 beaches as well as the popular fishing jetty on Anderson's Inlet.  At the edge of the Second Estate is an elevated viewing platform that allows visitors to look out across Anderson's Inlet and view the many kangaroos that call the quiet eastern shores home.
The Third Estate is a sparsely populated and underdeveloped area leading to the tip of the peninsula (Point Smythe).  This estate has the Doyle's Road foreshore reserve and the Point Smythe reservation, home to many wandering tracks that lead to secluded beaches on both shores of the peninsula and to the tip at the mouth of Anderson's Inlet.
The Tour de Tarwin is held every Easter and is a joint Venus Bay / Tarwin Lower initiative. Whilst it is a cycling event at heart, everyone including walkers are encouraged to participate.
In recent years the residents of Venus Bay and nearby Tarwin Lower (5 km closer to Melbourne) have fought off developers seeking to drain the environmental wetlands and set up marina and resort developments.  Today the fight appears to be strongly in the favour of the local residents.
In 2017, the locals at Venus Bay stated their displeasure over excessive harvesting of the pipi shellfish by daytrippers who came from Melbourne, mainly Chinese people. Some incidents of vandalism were reported from the area. However, the locals urged that the anger was not racially charged, but was an attempt to safeguard the ecological balance of the region. "

The story is a traditional story written for children.  It is set 'In the dreamtime ...',  when the emu flies higher than all the other birds, and lives in the Milky Way.  The other birds who fly close to the ground are jealous.  The brolga tell the emu that if its wings were made smaller it would be able to fly even higher, and because the emu wants to fly higher it lets the other birds trim its wings.  With small wings, the emu can't fly at all and will always stay that way.
In the book Charles is quoted:

'I was born in Beagle Bay Mission.  My mother Angela Mandora and father brought me up.  I went to school at the Mission until I was fifteen.  The nuns taught me.  There's nobody else now who knows the language, only a few, one or two people but they don't know it well. I would like for children to learn Nyulnyul language.  I remember when I was young, my parents told me olden day stories about the emu and a brolga.  I began working with Bill McGregor on language years ago at Beagle Bay.  This is just one of the stories and I am glad it is published at last.  I'm proud the emu is in a book.  I will be eighty-two on the 15th July' "

473 ," The succession order to the throne of the Romanian monarchy, abolished since 1947, was regulated by the monarchical constitution of 1938, suspended by the Royal Law Decree no. 3052 of September 1940 and the 1884 Law of the Romanian Royal House Rules enacted pursuant to the 1866 Constitution of Romania which had confirmed the enthronement of Prince Karl (Carol) of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. The 1938 Constitution stipulated Salic law, according to which the throne was hereditary in King Carol I's legitimate descent and, if his male issue failed, in the descent of his brothers of the Sigmaringen princely branch of the House of Hohenzollern, according to agnatic primogeniture and to the perpetual exclusion of females and their descendants. The last monarch to reign in Romania was King Michael I, who was born in 1921, abdicated his throne on 30 December 1947 under coercion, and went into exile in Switzerland. He died on 5 December 2017 in Aubonne, Switzerland.

 "
474 ," Pacaca, also called Pacacua, was a Costa Rican indigenous kingdom of the 16th century, whose inhabitants belonged to the Huetar people and culture and whose main seat was in the current Mora Canton, San José Province, Costa Rica, in the place called today with the name of Tabarcia.The kingdom of Pacaca was the first indigenous community of the Central Valley of Costa Rica that had contact with the Spanish, in 1522. The news about this town and its king Huetara come from the relationship written by the treasurer Andrés de Cereceda regarding the towns visited by the expedition of Gil González Dávila in 1522-1523 and the amount of baptisms carried out and the gold obtained in each one. After passing through the domains of a king named Cob (which historian Ricardo Fernández Guardia locates in the Tusubres and Carlos Molina Montes de Oca between the Naranjo and Savegre rivers) the expedition continued twelve leagues (sixty-six kilometers) through the coast, with southeast-northwest direction, and then marched into the territory for a distance of eight leagues (forty-four kilometers), until reaching the Western Huetar Kingdom. Cereceda succinctly stated that 'Chief Huetara is 20 leagues ahead, 12 along the coast and 8 inland: 28 souls were baptized: he gave 433 pesos, 4 tomines.' The small number of baptisms and the small amount of gold obtained seem to indicate that it was not a particularly rich or important community, although it must also be taken into account that González Dávila did not explore further and his expedition soon returned to the coast to continue the trip northwest.
In his work Garabito, nuestra raíz perdida (1981), dedicated to the figure of a great king Huetar, Oscar Bákit raised the possibility that the monarch visited by González Dávila had belonged to the Mesoamerican culture groups, which at the beginning of the 16th century were located in various places in the Costa Rican Pacific, such as Chomes, Gurutina and Chorotega. However, Carlos Molina Montes de Oca, in Garcimuñoz, la ciudad que nunca murió, identifies the town of Huetar with the indigenous kingdom of Pacaca, which was in the interior, near the current Tabarcia, precisely in a region consistent with the distances consigned by Cereceda, and that belonged to the great cultural space called today as Intermediate Area. The belonging of the town of Huetar to the Intermediate Area and not to the Mesoamerican cultural space seems to be confirmed by the fact that with respect to the next kingdom visited by the expeditionaries on the coast, that of Chorotega, Cereceda stated that '... it is Caribbean (man-eating) ), and from now on they are ... '. Indeed, it is known without a doubt that both Chorotega and the next two kings visited, Gurutina and Chomes, belonged to the cultural area of Mesoamerica, where the custom of ritual anthropophagy prevailed.On the other hand, it is quite possible that Huetara was not the monarch's own name, but that of his people or that of the language he spoke, since the denomination of huetares was extensive to a large number of indigenous peoples in Costa Rica. "
475 ," Roger A. Agpawa is an American mayor of Markham, Illinois.  He had served as fire chief in neighboring Country Club Hills, Illinois.

486 ," Mark Raymond Came (born 14 September 1961) is an English former professional footballer who made more than 300 Football League appearances for Bolton Wanderers, Chester City and Exeter City. He is now manager of non-league side Barnton.
Came began his playing career with Middlewich Athletic and joined Nantwich Town in October 1982. He soon moved on to Winsford United, who he played for until Bolton Wanderers gave him his first Football League chance when they signed him in April 1984. Came became a regular for Wanderers over the next four years, winning promotion from Division Four in 1987–88. But a broken leg early in the 1988–89 season after a tackle by Chester City's striker Ian Benjamin ruled him out for more than a year thus ending interest in him by Arsenal, Ipswich Town and Everton. After this Came struggled to re-establish himself in the Bolton side and in December 1992 he ironically moved across the north-west to Chester.
Although Came was unable to save Chester from relegation to Division Three in his first season with the club, he helped them win promotion straight back the following season. The campaign memorably saw him deputise in goal for almost the entire 90 minutes away at Scarborough when regular goalkeeper Billy Stewart suffered an injury in the warm-up. Came kept a clean sheet as Chester won 1–0 and he struck up a solid central defensive pairing with Colin Greenall as City sealed the runners-up spot.
But in July 1994 Came opted to remain in Division Three by joining Exeter City, where he won player of the season in his two years with the Grecians. This marked the end of his professional career, as he made a surprise return to Winsford.
He played for Winsford until retiring through injury in December 1998, but he remained involved at the club and was appointed manager for the 1999–2000 season.Came was appointed manager of Cheshire side Barnton in January 2006. He remained in charge until resigning in January 2008.His son Shaun Came has played professionally for Macclesfield Town. "

514 ," The Grand Harbour Lighthouse was a Canadian lighthouse marking the entrance to Grand Harbour, Grand Manan, New Brunswick. It was built and first lit in 1879 and was decommissioned in 1963. It was severely damaged in the Groundhog Day gale of 1976 and completely destroyed by a gale in November 2013.
The lighthouse was built in 1879 at Fish Fluke Point on Ross Island, a tidal island that forms the eastern shore of Grand Harbour on Grand Manan island in the Bay of Fundy. Construction cost $1,050, in addition to $150 for the land on which it was built. The square wooden tower had an attached dwelling for the light keeper's family. The lighthouse was equipped with a catoptric lens and was lit for the first time on 10 October 1879. The fixed white light was visible for up to 11 miles (18 km).The lighthouse was decommissioned after a light was installed on the breakwater at Ingalls Head, at the entrance to Grand Harbour opposite Ross Island. The last keeper left in August 1963 and the building was abandoned. It was severely damaged during the Groundhog Day gale in February 1976 and continued to deteriorate until it was declared 'North America's most endangered lighthouse' by Lighthouse Digest in 1999.The lighthouse, along with the whole of Ross Island, which is uninhabited, had been purchased by an American businessman in 1984. An effort spearheaded by Lighthouse Digest to raise enough money to save the building, in which the owner undertook to match funds donated by the public in 60 days, was unsuccessful. The building finally collapsed during a gale on 19 November 2013. "

516 ," Lexical diffusion is the hypothesis that a sound change is an abrupt change that spreads gradually across the words in a language to which it is applicable.
It contrasts with the Neogrammarian view that a sound change results from phonetically-conditioned articulatory drift acting uniformly on all applicable words, which implies that sound changes are regular, with exceptions attributed to analogy and dialect borrowing.
Similar views were expressed by Romance dialectologists in the late 19th century but were reformulated and renamed by William Wang and coworkers studying varieties of Chinese in the 1960s and the 1970s.
William Labov found evidence for both processes but argued that they operate at different levels. "

521 ," Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune, and the first Neptunian moon to be discovered. The discovery was made on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the direction opposite to its planet's rotation. At 2,710 kilometres (1,680 mi) in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System, the only satellite of Neptune massive enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and the second-largest planetary moon in relation to its primary, after Earth's Moon. Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto, Triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet captured from the Kuiper belt.Triton has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen, a mostly water-ice crust, an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal. The core makes up two-thirds of its total mass. The mean density is 2.061 g/cm3, reflecting a composition of approximately 15–35% water ice.During its 1989 flyby of Triton, Voyager 2 found surface temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C) and also discovered active geysers; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Triton. Triton is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Europa, and Saturn's Enceladus and Titan). As a consequence, its surface is relatively young, with few obvious impact craters. Intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains suggest a complex geological history. Part of its surface has geysers erupting sublimated nitrogen gas, contributing to a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than ​1⁄70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level. Voyager 2 was able to study only about 40% of its surface, and future missions have been proposed to revisit the Neptune system with a focus on Triton. "

527 ," The American Club was a London gentlemen's club, now dissolved. It was established to provide a centre for London's growing expatriate American community, with the inaugural meeting being held at the Savoy Hotel on 21 October 1918.
Shortly afterwards, it moved to its permanent home at 95 Piccadilly. Following the standard for gentlemen's clubs, it was established for men, with a separate American Women's Club in London - several requests made by the AWM to amalgamate were declined. Anthony Lejeune noted in the 1970s that 'the disappointing thing, to an English visitor, about the American Club is that it contains so little which is specifically American', citing its similarity to many other London clubs.The Club enjoyed the benefit of a long lease at a fixed rental dating back to the 1920s. When this expired in the 1980s the modern rent proposed effectively forced closure. As with many London clubs, membership had been in decline for some years. The premises then remained untenanted for many years.

543 ," The Samurai is a Japanese historical fiction television series made by Senkosha Productions during the early 1960s. Its original Japanese title was Onmitsu Kenshi (隠密剣士, 'Spy Swordsman'). The series premiered in 1962 on TBS and ran continuously until 1965 for ten self-contained story arcs (seasons), usually of 13 episodes each. Also created were two black-and-white feature films by Toei Company, made in 1964 by the same crew which created the TV series, and a stage show.
The Samurai proved to be highly successful despite its initially very limited budget. It was the first Japanese TV program ever screened in Australia, where it premiered in 1964 and built up a remarkably large fan-base among the local young audience at the time, rapidly becoming a cult favourite. Despite its massive popularity in Australia as well as success in Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines, the series was not widely screened elsewhere and its fame remains largely restricted to those countries.
It was followed in 1965 by the spin-off series The New Samurai (新隠密剣士, Shin Onmitsu Kenshi), featuring a completely new main character, ran only 39 episodes, compared to the 128 episodes of the original series.

In what has become among the most significant federalism cases of the Supreme Court, the Act was held to be within the power of the federal government.
The Anti-Inflation Act was passed in 1975, on recommendation of the Bank of Canada, to control the growing inflation of the past several years. Due to growing unease with the Act, the federal government put two questions to the Supreme Court on the validity of the Act. The major question being whether the Act was ultra vires of the federal government.
First, the Court noted that the subject-matter of the Act being inflation made it impossible to assign to one of the enumerated powers in the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, the Act would be able to be upheld only under the peace, order and good government (POGG) power under the Constitution which allowed the federal government to legislate in matters related to emergencies or matters of national concern. The Court looked at both options and found that the law could be saved under the emergency power of the peace, order and good government power. "

573 ," P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are a class of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that are responsive to stress stimuli, such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and are involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy. Persistent activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in muscle satellite cells (muscle stem cells) due to ageing, impairs muscle regeneration.p38 MAP Kinase (MAPK), also called RK or CSBP (Cytokinin Specific Binding Protein), is the mammalian orthologue of the yeast Hog1p MAP kinase, which participates in a signaling cascade controlling cellular responses to cytokines and stress.
Four p38 MAP kinases, p38-α (MAPK14), -β (MAPK11), -γ (MAPK12 / ERK6), and -δ (MAPK13 / SAPK4), have been identified. Similar to the SAPK/JNK pathway, p38 MAP kinase is activated by a variety of cellular stresses including osmotic shock, inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Ultraviolet light, and growth factors.
MKK3 and SEK activate p38 MAP kinase by phosphorylation at Thr-180 and Tyr-182. Activated p38 MAP kinase has been shown to phosphorylate and activate MAPKAP kinase 2 and to phosphorylate the transcription factors ATF2, Mac and MEF2. p38 also has been shown to phosphorylate post-transcriptional regulating factors like TTP.

578 ," The Bâtiment des Forces motrices (BFM), French for 'Power plant building', is the power house of a former hydro power plant and waterworks in Geneva called Usine des Forces Motrices, later Usine des Forces Motrices de la Coulouvrenière.
The structure is positioned near the point where the River Rhône flows out of Lake Geneva towards Lyon. It was created between 1883 and 1892 (and subjected to subsequent improvements) to exploit the flow of the river to provide water pressure to feed the city's water supply and a hydraulic power network. Furthermore, the weir of the structure was designed to regulate the level of the lake. The structure lost its original function as a power source in 1963, but it nevertheless continued to house pumping equipment to service Geneva's drinking water supply till 1988. The weir of the power plant was used some more years till it was taken over by the Barrage du Seujet (Seujet barrage) in 1995, which is located approximately fifty meters downstream from the BFM. Towards the end of the twentieth century the BFM was converted into an entertainment venue, reopening in 1997 as an opera house / concert hall designed by the architect Bernard Picenni in association with the acoustician Peutz and the scenographer dUCKS scéno.
At the time when the project was defined as a 'power plant' there was no automatic correlation between a 'power plant' and a public electricity supply. The idea in 1882 was to feed power in the form of pressurized water to local manufacturing businesses, who could use it to operate their own powered machinery, which might indeed include generators. Another objective involved using the pumped water to feed the reservoirs of the public drinking water supply. However, in 1887 electricity generation started in a building nearby the BFM, where generators were driven by pressurized water supplied from the BFM. The hydraulic power network needed a pressure valve to avoid the damage from excessive pressure within the network which was located beside the BFM and which was the precursor to Geneva's Jet d'Eau (fountain).

579 ," Macropodia rostrata, common names, the common spider crab, long-legged spider crab, long-legged crab, is a species of marine crab in the family Inachidae. The Macropodia Rostrata visually mimics many other types of small crabs with the exception of its long legs. By attaching algae to their thin legs, they can be confused with the stem of seaweed. This is both a defense mechanism and a predatory advantage, as unsuspecting fish will hide in seaweed beds from nearby predators. This behavior can be absent among larger crabs, and those that live at great depths like giant Japanese spider crabs. "
580 ," The Synagogue of the Priests of Djirt (Hebrew Beit Knesset Kohanim HaDintreisa Hebrew: בית הכנסת כהנים הדינתרייתא‎, Arabic: كنيس كوهانيم جيرت‎) is a synagogue located in Hara Kbira 'Greater Neighborhood', the Jewish neighbourhood located on the outskirts of Houmt El Souk, on the Tunisian island of Djerba.

591 ," U.S. Route 40 or U.S. Highway 40 (US 40), also known as the Main Street of America, is a major east–west United States Highway traveling across the United States from the Mountain States to the Mid-Atlantic States. As with most routes whose numbers end in a zero, US 40 once traversed the entire United States. It is one of the first U.S. Highways created in 1926 and its original termini were in San Francisco, California and Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the western United States, US 40 was functionally replaced by Interstate 80 (I-80), resulting in the route being truncated multiple times. US 40 currently ends at a junction with I-80 in Silver Summit, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City.
Starting at its western terminus in Utah, US 40 crosses a total of 12 states, including Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. US 40 passes through or by major cities including Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, Baltimore, and Wilmington. Three former and four current state capitals lie along the route. For much of its route, US 40 runs parallel to or concurrently with several major Interstate Highways: I-70 from Colorado to Washington, Pennsylvania; and again from Hancock, Maryland to Baltimore; I-64 in parts of Missouri and Illinois; I-68 along the Maryland Panhandle; and I-95 from Baltimore to New Castle, Delaware.
The route was built on top of several older highways, most notably the National Road and the Victory Highway. The National Road was created in 1806 by an act of Congress to serve as the first federally funded highway construction project. When completed it connected Cumberland, Maryland, with Vandalia, Illinois. The Victory Highway was designated as a memorial to World War I veterans and ran from Kansas City, Missouri to San Francisco. Other important roads that have become part of US 40 include Zane's Trace in Ohio, Braddock Road in Maryland and Pennsylvania, the Black Horse Pike in New Jersey, part of the Oregon Trail in Kansas, and the Lincoln Highway throughout most of California.

According to Sandon (1983) his popularity as a royal courtier was in part due to his ability as a musician, particularly as a player of the virginal. He is known to have composed at least one work of church music, namely Ave Vulnus Lateris ('Hail, O Wound of the Side'), a short votive antiphon in honour of one of the Five Holy Wounds of Jesus, his authorship of which is recorded in Peterhouse College manuscripts 471–474, held in the Cambridge University Library, comprising four partbooks from a set of five copied late in the reign of King Henry VIII, which contain seventy-two pieces of Latin church music. As a courtier-musician he well represents the ideal royal courtier described in The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione (d.1529) and also in The Boke Named The Governour by Sir Thomas Elyot (d.1546).Although he was born into a minor gentry family of Devonshire, he founded a dynasty of substantial landed gentry that survives to the present day, his heir (albeit via several female lines) being the Conservative Member of Parliament Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (born 1958), of Charborough House.

Poland was 'compensated' for this territorial loss with the pre-War German eastern territories, at the expense of losing its eastern regions. The Polish People's Republic regime described the territories as the 'Recovered Territories'. The  number of Poles in the Kresy in the year 1939 was around 5.274 million, but after ethnic cleansing in 1939-1945 by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and Ukrainian nationalist forces consisted of approximately 1.8 million inhabitants.  The post-World War II territory of Poland was significantly smaller than the pre-1939 land areas, shrinking by some 77,000 square kilometres (30,000 sq mi) (roughly equaling that of the territories of Belgium and the Netherlands combined).

647 ," The 23S rRNA is a 2904 nt long (in E. coli) component of the large subunit (50S) of the bacterial/archean ribosome. The ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity resides in domain V of this rRNA, and this domain is the most common binding site for antibiotics that inhibit translation. A well-known member of this antibiotic class, chloramphenicol, acts by inhibiting peptide bond formation, with recent 3D-structural studies showing two different binding sites depending on the species of ribosome. Linezolid and  quinupristin-dalfopristin also bind to the 23S rRNA, and cross-resistance has been demonstrated between these antibiotics. Compared to 16S rRNA genes, 23S rRNA genes typically have higher sequence variations including insertions and/or deletions.The eukaryotic homolog of the 23S rRNA is the 28S ribosomal RNA, with a region filled by the 5.8S ribosomal RNA.

648 ," The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing.  The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. This voting procedure is carried out in a parameter space, from which object candidates are obtained as local maxima in a so-called accumulator space that is explicitly constructed by the algorithm for computing the Hough transform.
The classical Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image, but later the Hough transform has been extended to identifying positions of arbitrary shapes, most commonly circles or ellipses. The Hough transform as it is universally used today was invented by Richard Duda and Peter Hart in 1972, who called it a 'generalized Hough transform' after the related 1962 patent of Paul Hough. The transform was popularized in the computer vision community by Dana H. Ballard through a 1981 journal article titled 'Generalizing the Hough transform to detect arbitrary shapes'. "

The first statue Wickham built was of the Blessed Virgin Mary crushing a snake under her feet. More statues followed of Tecumseh the Indian Chief, and of World War I hero Alvin York. In 1961 Wickham built an equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson. One of his largest statues was a memorial to honor his son Ernest Wickham and other local soldiers of Montgomery County, Tennessee who died in World War II.  Wickham continued building statues until his death in 1970. By that time, he had built over forty statues using only simple materials of chicken wire, rebar and concrete.
In 2001 the Customs House Museum in Clarksville, Tennessee had a yearlong exhibition of his work.
Today some of the statues still stand along Buck Smith Road in Palmyra in spite of much aging and vandalism.

658 ," The Iran–Israel proxy conflict, or Iran–Israel proxy war and Iran–Israel Cold War, is a proxy war between Iran and Israel in the 21st century. The conflict is bound in the political struggle of Iranian leadership against Israel and its declared aim to dissolve the Jewish state, with the counter aim of Israel to prevent nuclear weapons being acquired by the Iranian government and downgrading its allies and proxies such as the Lebanese Hezbollah political-militant organization.
The conflict gradually emerged from Iran's hostile stance toward Israel following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, into covert Iranian support of Hezbollah during the South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000) and by 2005 developed into a proxy regional conflict. In 2006, Iran was actively involved in supporting Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and in parallel began supporting Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel, on the other hand, initiated a campaign to harm the Iranian nuclear program, utilizing several anti-regime militias within Iran. Upon the onset of the Syrian Civil War, the conflict escalated and by 2018 turned into direct Iranian-Israeli warfare.
Key issues in the conflict include Iran's support of groups opposing Israel, Israel's support of anti-Iranian rebel groups, Iran's nuclear program, and Israel's ties with other rivals of Iran such as Saudi Arabia and the United States. The involvement of both countries in the Syrian Civil War has created additional possibilities for direct conflict between the two states.Iran has provided significant support to Hezbollah Hamas and PIJ, whereas Israel has supported the People's Mujahedin of Iran and has conducted assassinations and attacks against Iranian targets directly. Israel has also conducted cyber warfare against Iran, and has publicly advocated for international military action against Iran.Israel has accused Iran of attempting to form a continuous land transport route from Iran via Iraq and Syria to Lebanon,  which Israel views as a significant strategic threat.Iran views Israel as an illegitimate 'Zionist regime' and its leadership has accused Israel of being an American client state hostile to Muslims.

690 ," An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols. Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations (variable declarations that are declared to be both static and final). All methods of an Interface do not contain implementation (method bodies) as of all versions below Java 8. Starting with Java 8, default and static methods may have implementation in the interface definition. Then, in Java 9, private and private static methods were added. At present, a Java interface can have up to six different types.
Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented. A class that implements an interface must implement all of the non-default methods described in the interface, or be an abstract class. Object references in Java may be specified to be of an interface type; in each case, they must either be null, or be bound to an object that implements the interface.
One benefit of using interfaces is that they simulate multiple inheritance.  All classes in Java  must have exactly one base class, the only exception being java.lang.Object (the root class of the Java type system); multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed. However, an interface may inherit multiple interfaces and a class may implement multiple interfaces. "

692 ," Marconi Stallions Football Club is an Australian semi-professional soccer club based in Fairfield, Sydney, New South Wales. The club has been crowned Australian champion four times, a national record it shares with South Melbourne and Sydney City Hakoah.
The Stallions are the soccer team of Club Marconi, a social and sporting club founded in 1958 by immigrants from Italy who settled in Sydney's western suburbs. It earned promotion to the top tier of soccer in New South Wales and established itself as one of the strongest clubs in Sydney during the 1970s, before becoming a founding member of the National Soccer League in 1977. Marconi was, along with South Melbourne, one of just two clubs to compete in all 27 seasons of the now-defunct National Soccer League.

Marconi has produced at least six former captains of the Australian national team, while former Italian national team striker Christian Vieri came through its junior ranks while his father Roberto lived and played in Sydney.   Other Marconi youth products include former Australian winger Harry Kewell, veteran national team goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, ex-Lazio and Fiorentina midfielder Paul Okon, and former Bari striker Frank Farina, who went on to coach the Australian national team.Marconi currently competes in the National Premier Leagues NSW; the second tier of the game in Australia. Its home games are played at the 9000-capacity Marconi Stadium in the suburb of Bossley Park in Sydney's west; a venue known affectionately by players and fans as the Palace. Over the years, the club has been known as Club Marconi, Marconi-Datsun Leopards, Marconi-Fairfield and Marconi Stallions.

It serves both as an individual membership organisation, with more than 700 members, and as an umbrella organisation for 33 affiliated residents' associations and conservation societies that cover specific areas of Kensington.The society's objectives are 'to preserve and improve the amenities of Kensington for the public benefit by stimulating interest in its history and records, promoting good architecture and planning in its future development and by protecting, preserving and improving its buildings, open spaces and other features of beauty or historic or public interest.”The society was created in 1953 by a local resident, Gay Christiansen, who fought but lost a proposal to replace several historical houses on Young Street in central Kensington with a multi-storey car park. Realising that local opinion wasn’t considered or reflected in the planning process, she started the Kensington Society and was its driving force for more than 40 years.Among the successful campaigns by the society since the 1950s are the preservation of Leighton House, the saving of the remaining east wing of the severely bomb-damaged Holland House, and a revision of the originally proposed Princess Diana memorial garden  in Kensington Gardens after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. The proposal would have drastically changed large parts of the gardens. Instead, the compromise solution became the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens, and the 7-mile (11 km) Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park.

750 ," Skin is the layer of usually soft, flexible outer tissue covering the body of a vertebrate animal, with three main functions: protection, regulation, and sensation.Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton, have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means 'of the skin' (from Latin cutis, skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless.
The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates.  Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around  the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as 'crows feet' and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and is the thickest skin on the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.Fur is dense hair. Primarily,  fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather. Reptiles and most fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β-keratins. Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.  Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions. "
751 ," Stranger in the City was the second solo album by John Miles and was released in 1977. It was awarded BPI Silver Certification on 19 July 1977. 
Recording sessions with its producer and orchestral arranger Rupert Holmes started in the summer of 1976 in the United States when Miles was promoting his first album 'Rebel.' The bulk of the album was recorded in England.
For this album, Miles recruited Australian keyboardist Gary Moberley because Miles felt that his previous album was missing something funky.
Both 'Remember Yesterday' and 'Slow Down' charted in the UK (respectively 32 and 10) and would be the last Miles singles to chart in Britain until 1983. Although the singles did fairly well, the album itself barely cracked the top 40 of the UK chart. However, the cut 'Slow Down' proved to be Miles' biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Disco chart, and No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977. 
'Remember Yesterday' was written about Bob Marshall, who was according to Miles a very romantic type, because he drifted around from girl to girl. 
A track of the title song had been recorded during the sessions of Rebel and was originally planned to be released as the B-side of 'Highfly', but was shelved. It was orchestrated by Holmes who added percussion in New York performed by recording legend Jimmy Maelen.
'Manhattan Skyline' was written about the first impressions Miles and Marshall had of New York and was recorded entirely in Manhattan. In 1977, singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester covered the beautiful Miles-Marshall ballad 'Time' which on 'Stranger in the City' was performed solely by Miles at the piano accompanied by strings and brass.
In 2007, the album was rereleased and remastered with several bonus tracks. "

755 ," Heinrich Knote (November 26, 1870 – January 15, 1953) was an outstanding German dramatic tenor with an international reputation.
Born in Munich, he studied in that Bavarian city with Emmanuel Kirschner before joining the Munich Opera in 1892, debuting in Lortzing's Der Waffenschmied. Munich remained his base for the rest of the 19th century, although he did also appear at other German opera houses during this period.
Gradually Knote's voice, which had begun as a light lyric tenor, grew in size and stamina. By 1900, he was able to undertake Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore as well as heavy Wagner roles.
The seeds of Knote's international reputation as a top-flight exponent of Wagnerian operatic parts were planted in 1901 when he sang for the first time at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although his debut season was not an unqualified success, he showed considerable promise, and he was invited back by Covent Garden's management, appearing there again in 1903, 1907–08, and 1913. During these subsequent Covent Garden seasons he sang even more impressively than he had during his first London season, and was now much admired in the Wagnerian roles of Tristan, Siegfried, Tannhauser, Erik, Walther and Lohengrin.
Knote made his American debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 3 December 1904 in Die Meistersinger. He was so successful in this and other Wagner operas that during his three seasons with the Met company, his popularity was said to have almost rivalled that of the Met's superstar tenors Enrico Caruso and, from the previous generation, Jean de Reszke.
Surprisingly enough, Knote never sang at the Bayreuth Festival. (His legato-based method of singing would not have been a good fit in any case with Bayreuth's then favoured sprechgesang style of vocalism.) He did, however, enter into a contract with the artistically esteemed Dresden Opera; but this was cancelled suddenly in 1909 after a dispute with management. Knote spent the First World War period in Germany and became the principal tenor of the Charlottenburg Opera in 1917. After the war, Munich once again became his artistic home although he was engaged for a short time by the Hamburg Opera. He sang in the United States for the last time in 1923-24, appearing as Tristan, Walther and Rienzi with a German opera company.
He retired from the operatic stage in Munich in 1932 and taught singing. At the age of 82, he died in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
Knote had a handsome stage presence and possessed a strong, smooth, resonant voice with a lively, but rarely intrusive, vibrato. He was additionally praised by music critics of the day for the clarity of his diction. Vocal historians regard him as being one of Germany's best ever Wagnerian tenors. "

757 ," The All Japan Band Association (AJBA) (全日本吹奏楽連盟/Zennihon Suisōgaku Renmei) is an organization that exists solely for the purpose of facilitating an enormous annual music competition among Japanese wind bands. This competition has largely promoted the concert band idiom (called buraban in Japanese), but in recent years AJBA has also included separate entries for marching band and smaller chamber music ensembles within its national competition.
The AJBA competition includes categories for elementary school, middle school, high school, university, company, and community bands. It is an extremely competitive three-tiered contest, with local, regional, and national levels of competition. In some categories - middle school for example - the school bands from the most competitive urban districts that manage to reach the national level of competition are statistically among the top 0.5% in all of Japan.

The renowned Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra is usually hired to make the definitive premier recordings of the required pieces commissioned each year for AJBA's national competition. The final (national) stage of the competition is regularly held in Fumon Hall, an auditorium located on the campus of the Rissho Kosei Kai religious organization in central Tokyo.

Amongst the theories advanced in the book, Lane endorses the hydrogen hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell, whereby mitochondria are the original defining characteristic of the structure. He argues that the event was an exceedingly improbable one and questions the likelihood of it having happened elsewhere in the Universe. He also suggests that the necessity for genetic compatibility between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lies behind the differentiation of biological genders, ensuring that only one sexual partner contributes mitochondrial DNA to offspring.
Steven Rose in The Guardian said that the book contains 'one of the most interesting stories modern biology has to tell'. It was shortlisted for the Royal Society  Science Book Prize in 2006.

815 ," Chocolat Poulain (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɔkɔla pulɛ̃]) is one of the oldest chocolate brands in France. It is known particularly for its bars of eating and cooking chocolate, as well as its Poulain Orange product, which is a chocolate drink mix. The icon of the brand is a jumping foal, which is a wordplay on the creator's name 'Poulain', which is French for foal. 
Victor-Auguste Poulain began the mass production of chocolate in 1848 in Blois, France, before forming a limited company in 1893. He believed that a commercial future in chocolate would be found by selling to the masses and was innovative in industrialising the production of chocolate and in widespread marketing campaigns targeting children and families. In 1975, Chocolat Poulain was the sponsor of the mountains classification in the Tour de France when its distinctive polka jersey was introduced; the jersey's design was based on their chocolate bars that were covered in a polka dot wrapper.The company was bought by Cadbury Schweppes in 1988. It was sold to Kraft Food in 2010 (later Mondelēz International) and since 2017 belongs to Eurazeo. "
816 ," The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures sacred to Christians, Jews, Samaritans, Rastafari and others. They generally consider the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. The Bible appears in the form of an anthology, a compilation of texts of a variety of forms that are all linked by the belief that they collectively contain the word of God. These texts include theologically-focused historical accounts, hymns, parables, didactic letters, erotica, sermons, poetry, and prophecies.
Those books included in the Bible by a tradition or group are called canonical, indicating that the tradition/group views the collection as the true representation of God's word and will. A number of Biblical canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents from denomination to denomination. The Hebrew Bible overlaps with the Greek Septuagint and the Christian Old Testament. The Christian New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the biblical apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.
Attitudes towards the Bible also differ among Christian groups. Roman Catholics, high church Anglicans, Methodists and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of both the Bible and sacred tradition, while many Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept rose to prominence during the Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only infallible source of Christian teaching. Others though, advance the concept of prima scriptura in contrast.The Bible has had a massive influence on literature and history, especially in the Western world, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed using movable type. According to the March 2007 edition of Time, the Bible 'has done more to shape literature, history, entertainment, and culture than any book ever written. Its influence on world history is unparalleled, and shows no signs of abating.' With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. As of the 2000s, it sells approximately 100 million copies annually. "

821 ," Dewan Bahadur / Diwan Bahadur was a title of honor awarded during British rule in India. It was awarded to individuals who had performed faithful service or acts of public welfare to the nation. From 1911 the title was accompanied by a special Title Badge. Dewan literally means Prime Minister in Indian context and Bahadur means brave. 
This title was above Rao Bahadur title and people with Rao Bahadur could be elevated to status of Diwan Bahadur.Further, the Prime Ministers of Indian Princely States were known as Dewan/Diwan.

822 ," In the United States, the compensation of company executives is distinguished by the forms it takes and its dramatic rise over the past three decades and wide-ranging criticism leveled against it.
In the past three decades in America executive compensation or pay has risen dramatically beyond what can be explained by changes in firm size, performance, and industry classification. It is the highest in the world in both absolute terms and relative to median salary in the US. It has been criticized not only as excessive, but also for 'rewarding failure'—including massive drops in stock price, and much of the national growth in income inequality. Observers differ as to how much of the rise in and nature of this compensation is a natural result of competition for scarce business talent benefiting stockholder value, and how much is the work of manipulation and self-dealing by management unrelated to supply, demand, or reward for performance. Federal laws and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations have been developed on compensation for top senior executives in the last few decades, including a $1 million limit on the tax deductibility of compensation not 'performance-based', and a requirement to include the dollar value of compensation in a standardized form in annual public filings of the corporation.While an executive may be any corporate 'officer'—including president, vice president, or other upper-level manager—in any company, the source of most comment and controversy is the pay of chief executive officers (CEOs) (and to a lesser extent the other top five highest-paid executives) of large publicly traded firms. Most of the private sector economy in the United States is made up of such firms where management and ownership are separate, and there are no controlling shareholders. This separation of those who run a company from those who directly benefit from its earnings, create what economists call a 'principal–agent problem', where upper-management (the 'agent') has different interests, and considerably more information to pursue those interests, than shareholders (the 'principals'). This 'problem' may interfere with the ideal of management pay set by 'arm's length' negotiation between the executive attempting to get the best possible deal for him/her self, and the board of directors seeking a deal that best serves the shareholders, rewarding executive performance without costing too much. The compensation is typically a mixture of salary, bonuses, equity compensation (stock options, etc.), benefits, and perquisites. It has often had surprising amounts of deferred compensation and pension payments, and unique features such as executive loans (now banned), and post-retirement benefits, and guaranteed consulting fees.The compensation awarded to executives of publicly-traded companies differs from that awarded to executives of privately held companies. 'The most basic differences between the two types of businesses include the lack of publicly traded stock as a compensation vehicle and the absence of public shareholders as stakeholders in private firms.' The compensation of senior executives at publicly traded companies is also subject to certain regulatory requirements, such as public disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "

826 ," The Beano is the longest running British children's comic magazine, published by DC Thomson in Dundee, Scotland. The comic first appeared on 30 July 1938, and was published weekly. In September 2009, The Beano's 3,500th issue was published. One of the best selling comics in the UK, along with The Dandy, the weekly circulation of The Beano in April 1950 was 1,974,072. The Beano is currently edited by John Anderson. Each issue is published on a Wednesday, with the issue date being that of the following Saturday. The Beano reached its 4,000th issue on 28 August 2019.
Its characters include Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx, The Bash Street Kids, The Numskulls, Roger the Dodger, Billy Whizz and Tricky Dicky. Earlier characters who have been phased out include Ball Boy, Les Pretend, Ivy the Terrible, The Three Bears and Pansy Potter. Some old characters, like Biffo the Bear, Lord Snooty, Baby Face Finlayson and Little Plum, have more recently made a return as 'funsize' quarter-page strips.
The style of Beano humour has shifted noticeably over the years, though the longstanding tradition of anarchic humour has remained. Historically, many protagonists were characterised by their immoral behaviour, e.g. pranking/bullying (Dennis the Menace), dishonesty (Roger the Dodger) and even robbery (Baby Face Finlayson and The Three Bears). Although the readers' sympathies are assumed to be with the miscreants, the latter are very often shown punished for their actions. Recent years have seen a rise in humour involving gross bodily functions, especially flatulence (which would have been taboo in children's comics prior to the 1990s), while depictions of corporal punishment have declined. For example, the literal slipper – the most common form of chastisement for characters such as Dennis, Minnie the Minx and Roger the Dodger – has become the name of the local chief of police (Sergeant Slipper).

831 ," Mehmet Ismail Shehu (January 10, 1913 – December 17, 1981) was an Albanian communist politician who served as the 23rd Prime Minister of Albania from 1954 to 1981. As an acknowledged military tactician, without whose leadership the communist partisans may well have failed in their battle to win Albania for the Marxist-Leninist cause, Shehu exhibited an ideological understanding and work ethic that singled him out for rapid promotion in the communist party. Mehmet Shehu shared power with Enver Hoxha from the end of the Second World War. According to official Albanian government sources, he committed suicide on December 17, 1981, after which the entire Shehu clan (his wife, Fiqirete Shehu Sanxhaktari, sons and other of his relatives) were arrested and imprisoned while Mehmet Shehu himself was denounced as 'one of the most dangerous traitors and enemies of his country'. Persistent rumors remain, however, that Shehu was actually murdered on orders from Hoxha. "
832 ," Bernard Haisch is a German-born American astrophysicist who has done research in solar-stellar astrophysics and stochastic electrodynamics.

835 ," A sky lobby is an intermediate interchange floor in a skyscraper where people can change from an express elevator that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator which stops at every floor within a segment of the building. When designing very tall (supertall) buildings, supplying enough elevators is a problem – travellers wanting to reach a specific higher floor may conceivably have to stop at a very large number of other floors on the way up to let other passengers off and on. This increases travel time, and indirectly requires many more elevator shafts to still allow acceptable travel times – thus reducing effective floor space on each floor for all levels. The other main technique to increase usage without adding more elevator shafts is double-deck elevators.
Early uses of the sky lobby include the original Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and 875 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago.

847 ," Charles Shirreff (26 July 1768 – 5 May 1847) was an early Canadian businessman and public official.
He was born in Leith, Scotland in 1768. In 1817, he migrated to Smith's Creek, later Port Hope, in Upper Canada. He obtained a grant of land in Fitzroy Township in the upper Ottawa Valley and moved there in 1818. He founded the town of Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario on the Ottawa River in 1831 and built a grist mill there.
His son, Robert, took the post of deputy surveyor general of woods, which regulated tree cutting on public lands in Upper and Lower Canada by collecting dues. Shirreff set up an informal arrangement where he measured the timber at Bytown and Robert collected the dues at Quebec City where the rafts of timber were sold. Shirreff proposed a new system, which was accepted in 1832, where a system of timber limits was used to control the cutting of trees on crown lands. A down payment was paid by the lumber company and then the fees were paid in full when the timber was sold.
This system was challenged in 1832 on the Gatineau River due to illegal cutting along the river; this area was exempted from public sale of timber limits. Although Shirreff protested, the 'Gatineau Privilege' remained in place. A scandal surfaced when the company managing affairs at Quebec went bankrupt; it was discovered that they had been accepting promissory notes rather than bonds, resulting in lost revenue to the provinces. The Shirreffs were replaced in the Bytown office in 1836. Charles continued to expand his business interests at Fitzroy Harbour, adding a sawmill and a store.
During the 1830s, Shirreff promoted a plan to connect the Ottawa River to Georgian Bay via a canal.
Shirreff died in Bytown in 1847. "

939 ," Eucryptite is a lithium bearing aluminium silicate mineral with formula LiAlSiO4. It crystallizes in the trigonal - rhombohedral crystal system. It typically occurs as granular to massive in form and may pseudomorphically replace spodumene. It has a brittle to conchoidal fracture and indistinct cleavage. It is transparent to translucent and varies from colorless to white to brown. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.67. Optically it is uniaxial positive with refractive index values of nω = 1.570 - 1.573 and nε = 1.583 - 1.587.
Its typical occurrence is in lithium-rich pegmatites in association with albite, spodumene, petalite, amblygonite, lepidolite and quartz.It occurs as a secondary alteration product of spodumene. It was first described in 1880 for an occurrence at its type locality, Branchville, Connecticut. Its name was from the Greek for well concealed, for its typical occurrence embedded in albite. "
940 ," A fictional book is a text created specifically for a work in an imaginary narrative that is referred to, depicted, or excerpted in a story, book, film, or other fictional work, and which exists only in one or more fictional works. A fictional book may be created to add realism or depth to a larger fictional work.  For example, George Orwell's novel  Nineteen Eighty-Four has excerpts from a book by Emmanuel Goldstein entitled The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism which provides background on concepts explored in the novel (both the named author (Goldstein) and the text on collectivism are made up by Orwell). 
A fictional book may provide the basis of the plot of a story, a common thread in a series of books or other works, or the works of a particular writer or canon of work. An example of a fictional book that is part of the plot of another work (in addition to Nineteen Eighty-Four) is Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle, in which the plot is about resistance members circulating a banned book entitled The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. An example of a fictional book linking a series is Encyclopedia Galactica, an imaginary set of encyclopedias created by Isaac Asimov and referred to in the novels in his Foundation Series. An example of an author referring to a fictional book in a number of unconnected works is Jack Vance's quotes from an imaginary  twelve-volume opus entitled Life by Unspiek, Baron Bodissey in Vance's novels (Bodissey is a fictional character created by Vance).

948 ," The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was an agreement between Great Britain and Portugal which fixed the boundaries between the British Central Africa Protectorate, (now Malawi) and the territories administered by the British South Africa Company in Mashonaland and Matabeleland (now parts of Zimbabwe) and North-Western Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Portuguese Mozambique, and also between the British South Africa Company administered territories of North-Eastern Rhodesia (now in Zambia), and Portuguese Angola.
This treaty brought to an end over 20 years of increasing disagreement over conflicting territorial claims in the eastern part of Central Africa, where Portugal had long-standing claims based on prior discovery and exploration but where British citizens set up missions and embryonic trading concerns in the Shire Highlands in what is now Malawi from the 1860s. These disagreements were increased in the 1870s and 1880s, firstly by a dispute over a British claim to part of Delagoa Bay and by the failure of bilateral negotiations between the two countries over the boundaries of Portuguese territories and secondly as a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, which set-out the doctrine of effective occupation. After the Berlin Conference, Portugal tried to establish a zone of effective occupation linking its colonies in Angola and Mozambique through expeditions making treaties that would establish protectorates over local peoples and obtaining recognition from other European powers. The relative success of these Portuguese efforts alarmed the British government of Lord Salisbury, which was also under pressure from missionaries in the Shire Highlands, and also Cecil Rhodes, who founded the British South Africa Company in 1888 with the aim of controlling as much of south-central Africa as it could. For these reasons, and in response to a minor armed conflict in the Shire Highlands, Lord Salisbury issued the 1890 British Ultimatum which required Portugal to evacuate the areas in dispute. Lord Salisbury refused the Portuguese request for arbitration and, after an abortive attempt to fix the boundaries of their respective territories in 1890, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was accepted by Portugal under duress.

950 ," The Kramers–Wannier duality is a symmetry in statistical physics.  It relates the free energy of a two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model at a low temperature to that of another Ising model at a high temperature.  It was discovered by Hendrik Kramers and Gregory Wannier in 1941.  With the aid of this duality Kramers and Wannier found the exact location of the critical point for the Ising model on the square lattice.
Similar dualities establish relations between free energies of other statistical models.  For instance, in 3 dimensions the Ising model is dual to an Ising gauge model. "
951 ," The culture of Finland combines indigenous heritage, as represented for example by the country's national languages Finnish (a Uralic language) and Swedish (a Germanic language), the sauna, with common Nordic and European cultural aspects. Because of its history and geographic location, Finland has been influenced by the adjacent areas, various Finnic and Baltic peoples as well as the former dominant powers of Sweden and Russia. Finnish culture is built upon the relatively ascetic environmental realities, traditional livelihoods, and heritage of egalitarianism (e.g. Everyman's right, universal suffrage) and the traditionally widespread ideal of self-sufficiency (e.g. predominantly rural lifestyles and modern summer cottages).
There are cultural differences among various regions of Finland, especially minor differences in dialect. Minorities, some of which have a status recognised by the state, such as the Sami, Swedish-speaking Finns, Romani, Jews, and Tatar, maintain their cultural identities within Finland. Many Finns are emotionally connected to the countryside and nature, as large-scale urbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon. "

959 ," Dansband ('dance band'), or danseband in Norwegian and Danish, is a Swedish term for a band that plays dansbandsmusik ('dance band music'). Dansbandsmusik is often danced to in pairs. Jitterbug and foxtrot music are often included in this category. The music is primarily inspired by swing, schlager, country, jazz, and rock. The main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s.
The terms dansband and dansbandsmusik were coined around 1970, when Swedish popular music developed a signature style. The genre developed primarily in Sweden, but has spread to neighbouring countries Norway, Denmark and the Swedish-speaking regions of Finland. When the music came to Norway it was first called 'svensktoppar' (from the Swedish radio music chart Svensktoppen, which was a major arena for dansband music before its rules changed in January 2003).
A dansband often travels by bus, performing several times every week year-round, outdoors in the summertime and indoors in the wintertime. Performances may also be held on a boat.
Several dansbands are named after their lead singer (whose name is sometimes shortened), followed by 'orkester' ('orchestra'). The tradition origins from the old dance orchestras, often named after their Kapellmeister. The possessive suffix 's' is often replaced by 'z' in dansband names. Some dansbands are named after earlier members.
The main audience for dansband music is middle-aged adults. The music is often performed live by the bands at venues where the main interest of the audience is dancing, rather than watching the performance on stage. However, many dansbands also record albums and singles. "

The song is essentially a full band performance by Prince & the Revolution, with backing vocals from Susannah Melvoin, and the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. The song also features a string arrangement by Clare Fischer. The song is set in a minor key, and written around a piano chord sequence, although the arrangement emphasizes an upfront guitar synth and a drum machine. The lyrics are about a man trying to reclaim a lover who is intent on leaving him for another. The song's title is a combination of the main idea of the song, and the line 'U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head' from the chorus. The single received a 12' extended release with intricate piano work and some dance commands from Prince.
The B-side was the LP version of 'Girls & Boys' in the US, but since that was already released as a single on its own in the UK, the B-side there was 'I Wanna Be Your Lover', from 1979's Prince.
Despite a large amount of publicity provided by its predecessors and the film Under the Cherry Moon, the single stalled at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and didn't fare much better in the U.K, where it reached number 36. "

972 ," The water dropworts, Oenanthe , are a genus of plants in the family Apiaceae.  Most of the species grow in damp ground, in marshes or in water.
Several of the species are extremely poisonous, the active poison being oenanthotoxin. The most notable of these is O. crocata, which lives in damp, marshy ground, and resembles celery with roots like a bunch of large white carrots. The leaves may be eaten safely by livestock, but the stems, and especially the carbohydrate-rich roots are much more poisonous.  Animals familiar with eating the leaves may eat the roots when these are exposed during ditch clearance – one root is sufficient to kill a cow, and human fatalities are also known. It has been referred to as the most poisonous of all British plants, and is considered particularly dangerous because of its similarity to several edible plants.The species O. javanica, commonly known as Chinese celery or Japanese parsley (seri; not to be confused with mitsuba or Japanese wild celery, a plant from a different genus) is edible and grown in several countries of eastern Asia, as well as in Italy and India, where the spring growth is relished as a vegetable.

The English name of the species derived from the French dormeuse, and the latter in turn possibly from the Languedocien radourmeire. "
974 ," Pterosaurs (; from Greek pteron and sauros, meaning 'wing lizard') were flying reptiles of the extinct clade or order Pterosauria. They existed during most of the Mesozoic: from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 to 66 million years ago). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.There were two major types of pterosaurs. Basal pterosaurs (also called 'non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs' or 'rhamphorhynchoids') were smaller animals with fully toothed jaws and, typically, long tails. Their wide wing membranes probably included and connected the hind legs. On the ground, they would have had an awkward sprawling posture, but their joint anatomy and strong claws would have made them effective climbers, and they may have lived in trees. Basal pterosaurs were insectivores or predators of small vertebrates. Later pterosaurs (pterodactyloids) evolved many sizes, shapes, and lifestyles. Pterodactyloids had narrower wings with free hind limbs, highly reduced tails, and long necks with large heads. On the ground, pterodactyloids walked well on all four limbs with an upright posture, standing plantigrade on the hind feet and folding the wing finger upward to walk on the three-fingered 'hand'. They could take off from the ground, and fossil trackways show at least some species were able to run and wade or swim. Their jaws had horny beaks, and some groups lacked teeth. Some groups developed elaborate head crests with sexual dimorphism. 
Pterosaurs sported coats of hair-like filaments known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pycnofibers grew in several forms, from simple filaments to branching down feathers. These are homologous to the down feathers found on both avian and some non-avian dinosaurs, suggesting that early feathers evolved in the common ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, possibly as insulation. In life, pterosaurs would have had smooth or fluffy coats that did not resemble bird feathers. They were warm-blooded (endothermic) active animals. The respiratory system had efficient unidirectional 'flow-through' breathing using air sacs, which hollowed out their bones to an extreme extent. Pterosaurs spanned a wide range of adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx, which reached wingspans of at least nine metres. The combination of endothermy, a good oxygen supply and strong muscles made pterosaurs powerful and capable flyers.
Pterosaurs are often referred to by popular media or the general public as 'flying dinosaurs', but dinosaurs are defined as the descendants of the last common ancestor of the Saurischia and Ornithischia, which excludes the pterosaurs. Pterosaurs are nonetheless more closely related to birds and other dinosaurs than to crocodiles or any other living reptile, though they are not bird ancestors. Pterosaurs are also colloquially referred to as pterodactyls, particularly in fiction and by journalists. However, technically, pterodactyl only refers to members of the genus Pterodactylus, and more broadly to members of the suborder Pterodactyloidea of the pterosaurs.Pterosaurs had a variety of lifestyles. Traditionally seen as fish-eaters, the group is now understood to have included hunters of land animals, insectivores, fruit eaters and even predators of other pterosaurs. They reproduced by eggs, some fossils of which have been discovered. "

977 ," Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space, sometimes referred to as 'stellar nurseries' or 'star-forming regions', collapse and form stars. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products.  It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function. Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a group of stars referred  as star clusters or stellar associations. "
978 ," Charles Henry Caffin (June 4, 1854 – January 14, 1918) was an Anglo-American writer and art critic, born in Sittingbourne, Kent, England.  After graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1876, with a broad background in culture and aesthetics, he engaged in scholastic and theatrical work. In 1888, he married Caroline Scurfield, a British actress and writer. They had two children, daughters Donna and Freda Caffin. In 1892, he moved to the United States. He worked in the decoration department of the Chicago Exposition, and after moving to New York City in 1897, he was the art critic of Harper's Weekly, the New York Evening Post, the New York Sun (1901–04), the International Studio, and the New York American. His publications are of a popular rather than a scholarly character, but he was an important early if equivocal advocate of modern art in America. His writings were suggestive and stimulating to laymen and encouraged interest in many fields of art. One of his last books, Art for Life's Sake (1913), described his philosophy, which argued that the arts must be seen as 'an integral part of life....[not] an orchid-like parasite on life' or a specialized or elite indulgence. He also argued strenuously for art education in American elementary schools and high schools and was a frequent lecturer. "

These definitions are the most widely recognized and verified definitions as used by manufacturers and procurement officers worldwide. 
Quite commonly, it is simply the waste that individuals routinely discard, either in a waste receptacle or a dump, or by littering, incinerating, pouring down the drain, or washing into the gutter.
Post-consumer waste is distinguished from pre-consumer waste, which is the reintroduction of manufacturing scrap (such as trimmings from paper production, defective aluminum cans, etc.) back into the manufacturing process.  Pre-consumer waste is commonly used in manufacturing industries, and is often not considered recycling in the traditional sense. "

1012 ," The Herzog-Albrecht-Gedächtniskirche (German for 'Duke Albert Memorial Church') was a Protestant church in northern Königsberg, Germany. Its name honored Albert I, Duke of Prussia (1490–1568), an early supporter of Lutheranism.
By the early 20th century, the churches of Tragheim and Neurossgarten were too far away for the growing population of Königsberg's Maraunenhof quarter, so a new church was planned in 1908 at Maraunenhof's König-Ottokar-Platz. Construction of the Neo-Romanesque building, designed by the architects H. Mattar and E. Scheler, began on 19 May 1911, with its dedication as the New Tragheim Church (Neuer Tragheimer Kirche) occurring on 12 January 1913. It became known as the Maraunenhof Church (Maraunenhofer Kirche) in 1928 when the parish became independent from Tragheim. It was also sometimes known as the König-Ottokar-Kirche, after King Ottokar II of Bohemia, namesake of the city and nearby square.
In 1933 during celebrations of the 450th anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther, the church was renamed the Herzog-Albrecht-Gedächtniskirche zu Königsberg-Maraunenhof. The interior of the church held life-size bronze figures of Saints John and Paul. The wooden crucifix was created by Georg Grasegger.
The memorial church was heavily damaged during the 1945 Battle of Königsberg. The Soviet administration in Kaliningrad demolished its remnants in 1972. The rectory was maintained, however, and was used first as a movie theatre and now as a children's music school named after E. T. A. Hoffmann. "

1021 ," The University of Plano was a liberal arts college that existed in Plano, Texas from 1964 to 1977.
The school was founded in 1964 by Robert J. Morris, an attorney and former judge known as an anti-Communist. Morris had served as chief counsel the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Morris had been the president of the University of Dallas from 1960 to 1962. Building on the difficulties faced by one of his children, Morris founded the school in 1964 with a focus on the education of mildly disabled college-age students using techniques from the Doman-Delacato Method, such as crawling and creeping, that were intended to stimulate brain development. He remained at the school until 1977 and it closed its doors shortly thereafter.Dr. Morris was committed to building a high-caliber, world-class, liberal arts university with a politically conservative posture.  His concept and vision attracted highly distinguished professors and staff from around the country.  Dr. Morris was also personally committed to students that had suffered injuries that impaired their physical articulation.  Incorporated into the foundation of the University was the School of Neurological Organization (NO) focusing on the exceptional Doman-Delacato methodology. While the programs Dr. Glen Doman and Dr. Carl Delacto developed were ostensibly for treatment of those suffering with an autistic diagnosis, they and Dr. Morris were confident that this program would be instrumental in helping and aiding the recovery of those with mild brain or nervous system damage that resulted from accidental occurrences.  Dr. Morris' ultimate goal was to both found a world-class university AND provide a unique environment where injured youths could be rehabilitated from their physical injuries while concurrently being otherwise able to participate in a superior curriculum of collegiate learning.  Dr. Morris' ingenuity pre-dated the now-popular concept of main-streaming those with brain injuries.
Using $250,000 borrowed from Republic National Life of Dallas, he put a down payment on 680 acres (2.8 km2) of land in northwest Plano. With $600,000 raised from a bond issue, he persuaded the government of Malaysia to donate to the school the nation's pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair, with the pagoda becoming the main building of the university.The University of Plano received its charter from the State of Texas on May 8, 1964 as a private, coeducational, nondenominational institution. The school was originally called the University of Lebanon, changing its name effective September 4, 1964 to reflect its location . The university's first classes were held in space leased in Dallas in the fall of 1965.The school had no endowment to speak of, other than the land it had purchased. The school's finances depended on rising values for the land it had purchased, based on the assumption that the growth of the Dallas area would push residential development towards Plano and hopes that portions of the land could be rezoned for commercial use, both of which would drive up the value of the land. Property purchased by Morris for the University in 1964 for $1,800 an acre, sold in 1969 for $3,000 an acre, and could obtain as much as $6,300 an acre by 1971. 15 acres (61,000 m2) of the school's land was rezoned for a shopping center and an additional 4 acres (16,000 m2) was rezoned for small retail.Despite warnings offered as far back as 1967, the school developed a heavy reliance on land speculation to meet its expenses. With the end of the land boom in 1975, the school was unable to use land sales to fund its activities. The school ran short of funds in 1976, and despite ownership of 698 acres (2.82 km2) and twenty buildings, was forced to close in July 1976.Records from the former University are not complete and many are not available as they were held by Dr. Robert Morris for some time. The chain of custody is unclear and many graduates have been unable to recover records. An alumni site was available at Universityofplano.org. Though still registered as of June 2017, the site only has a parking redirect link from GoDaddy.com. "

1024 ," Least absolute deviations (LAD), also known as least absolute errors (LAE), least absolute value (LAV), least absolute residual (LAR), sum of absolute deviations, or the L1 norm condition, is a statistical optimality criterion and the statistical optimization technique that relies on it. Similar to the least squares technique, it attempts to find a function which closely approximates a set of data. In the simple case of a set of (x,y) data, the approximation function is a simple 'trend line' in two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. The method minimizes the sum of absolute errors (SAE) (the sum of the absolute values of the vertical 'residuals' between points generated by the function and corresponding points in the data). The least absolute deviations estimate also arises as the maximum likelihood estimate if the errors have a Laplace distribution. It was introduced in 1757 by Roger Joseph Boscovich. "

1066 ," Live 8 was a string of benefit concerts that took place on 2 July 2005, in the G8 states and in South Africa. They were timed to precede the G8 conference and summit held at the Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Scotland from 6–8 July 2005. Both events also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty History campaign and the Global Call to Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on 2 July and one on 6 July. On 7 July, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50 billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa. More than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.
Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof announced the event on 31 May. Many former Live Aid acts offered their services to the cause. Prior to the official announcement of the event, many news sources referred to the event as Live Aid 2. However, Geldof and co-organiser Midge Ure have since explicitly said they do not think of the event as the same as Live Aid.

Organisers of Live 8 presented the 'Live 8 List' to the world leaders at the Live 8 call that politicians take action to 'Make Poverty History'. Names from the list also appeared on the giant televisions at each concert during the broadcast.
An official Live 8 DVD set was released on 7 November 2005 internationally and 8 November 2005 in the United States. It was released almost a year to the day after the release of the DVD of Live Aid on 8 November 2004.

1084 ," Takki (Arabic: تكي‎) is a Saudi Arabian drama web series that premiered in February 2012. Mohammad Makki, a 25-year-old male, directed this series. Since no cable channel would air this show, it was put exclusively on YouTube. It was also successful because Saudis are among the world's most avid watchers of YouTube. With Saudi society being one of the most conservative societies in the Middle East, Takki Series depicts its monarchy and strict Wahabbism. The comment section gives Makki an easy way to get feedback from the audience. 'Its presence on YouTube works to emphasize that it’s a product of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s (KSA’s) youth.' The series has 1 season with 14 episodes, each episode airing between 10–20 minutes. UTURN Entertainment produced and distributed Takki Series in its network, making it one of their shows that is posted on their YouTube Channel.
This series aims to target the Saudi Arabian youth by showing the daily lives of 6 young adults. In an interview with Arab News, Makki said, 'We want to bring our culture to life and narrow the gap between our different backgrounds in Saudi Arabia and, at the same time, show our Saudi society to the world. To show women wearing hijab, praying, Saudi youth problems and issues and narrow the gap between different mindsets as well as give an image about our culture in a jovial way.'
This show aims to bend the societal rules that are present in Saudi Arabia. The series focuses on depicting issues in Saudi society. These issues are: gender relations, family dynamics, friendship, poverty, racial tensions, and drug use.
Addressing these issues is one of the main reasons why Takki Series is one of the most popular web series to the Saudi Arabian youth.
The series also takes place in Jeddah, a famously liberal, at least in the Saudi Arabian context, seaside city.

The government has a less noticeable presence, and the police forces are much less stringent than they are in other areas. Jeddah also serves as a vacationing spot for the majority of Saudi Arabian citizens. Women are allowed more freedoms, from walking through malls and sitting in smoking bars to uncovering their faces. Jeddah hosts concerts of both classical music and rap. Public relations manager Rayyan al-Dahlawi reiterates the freedoms enjoyed in the city by stating, 'For people in Riyadh, Jeddah is their breathing space if they can't afford to go abroad.' "

In their seventh season under head coach Jim Sutherland, the Cougars compiled a 5–4–1 record (1–1 in AAWU, third), and outscored their opponents 213 to 167.The team's statistical leaders included Dave Mathieson with 1,492 passing yards, George Reed with 503 rushing yards, and Hugh Campbell with 848 receiving yards.Midway through the schedule, WSU was undefeated at 4–0–1, equaling their best start since 1936.

1116 ," Situated in the north-east of North Macedonia Cocev Kamen (Macedonian: Цоцев Камен) is a hilltop cave site of volcanic origin near the town of Kratovo. Objects (bone fossils) discovered near the cave suggest human presence since the Paleolithic. Authors agree that the site served as a gathering point for sacrificial rituals from the Neolithic, during the Bronze Age, throughout antiquity until the Middle Ages as clarified by an abundance of pottery shards, stone (flint) tools and bone fragments unearthed from the surrounding areas. Several caves and rock shelters are decorated with red figurative art work. Comparison with similar sites in Bulgaria and Italy suggests that the paintings are indeed prehistoric.Debated remains the notion that Cocev Kamen has also been used as an (astronomical) observatory. 'There are visible interventions on the stone surface everywhere, in the form of stairs, pools, thrones, and one big cave was completely rearranged, with a large part of its wall ripped off to make a fenced platform looking at the nearby hill, which contains big natural stones...' These alterations served ceremonial purposes during offerings to fertility deities. "

1119 ," Postmodern theory (PM) in anthropology originated in the 1960s along with the literary postmodern movement in general. Anthropologists working in this vein of inquiry seek to dissect, interpret and write cultural critiques.
One issue discussed by PM anthropologists is about subjectivity; because ethnographies are influenced by the disposition of the author, should their opinions be considered scientific?  Clifford Geertz, considered a founding member of postmodernist anthropology, advocates that, “anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third ones to boot” In the 21st century, some anthropologists use a form of standpoint theory; a person's perspective in writing and cultural interpretation of others is guided by their own background and experiences.
Other major tenets of postmodernist anthropology are: 

an emphasis on including the opinions and perspectives of the people being studied,
cultural relativism as a method of inquiry
skepticism towards the claims of science to producing objective and universally valid knowledge
the rejection of grand, universal schemes or theories which explain other cultures (Barrett 1996).A critique by non-anthropologists has been to question whether anthropologists may speak/write on behalf of cultural others.  Margery Wolf states that, “it would be as great a loss to have first-world anthropologists confine their research to the first world as it is (currently) to have third-world anthropologists confine theirs to the third world”. In the 21st century, the question has been resolved by pointing out that all cultural descriptions are of cultural others. All ethnographic writing is done by a person from one standpoint writing about others living in a different standpoint. Thus, the notion of anthropologists as 'culture brokers' (see Richard Kurin) has been adopted to explain why anthropologists from any given country write about cultural others. "

1121 ," The word dabar (Hebrew: דָּבָר‎) means 'word', 'talk' or 'thing' in Hebrew. Dabar occurs in various contexts in the Hebrew Bible. 
The Septuagint, the oldest translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, uses the terms rhema and logos as equivalents and uses both for dabar.In Christianity, the Old Testament concept of 'word event' represented by dabar carries over to the New Testament where revelation can be seen as events explained by words.

1129 ," Le Nove porcelain was made in the 18th century in the town now called Nove, near Bassano, then in the Republic of Venice's mainland territories, the terrafirma.  It was made at a factory owned by Pasquale Antonibon, who was already making fine maiolica in fashionable styles, which continued to be made alongside the porcelain.  Production of porcelain began in 1762 and ended when Antonibon died in 1773. But it resumed in 1781, when Francisco Parolin (or Parolini) leased the factory for twenty years in a partnership with the Antonibons, known as the 'Parolin period'.  This lasted until 1802.  Production of porcelain continued intermittently until 1835.
Initially soft-paste porcelain was made, but some hard-paste porcelain from about 1765, though soft-paste pieces are still assigned dates after this.  Some of the factory's products are also classified as terraglia, the Italian version of Staffordshire creamware, a fine earthenware.  The production was generally similar to that of the Cozzi porcelain factory in Venice itself, and used the same clays, so it can be difficult to distinguish between the two.

Bassano was the home of the prolific publishing house of the Remondini family, whose large output included popular prints, wallpaper, book illustrations, and decorative prints. These provided a ready source of images for the porcelain-painters of Le Nove, of whom the head was Giovanni Marcon, brought in by Parolin and still working for Baroni in about 1820. "

1131 ," William, Lord of Douglas (c. 1220 – c. 1274), known as 'Longleg', was a Scottish nobleman. He was the son of Archibald I, Lord of Douglas.
The years of the minority of King Alexander III (1249–1262) featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by the nationalistic Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, the other by pro-English Alan Durward, Justiciar of Scotia. The former dominated the early years of Alexander's reign.  In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at Kelso led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. Later both parties called a Meeting of the great Magnates of the Realm to establish a regency until Alexander came of age. William Lord of Douglas was one of the magnates called to witness. Douglas was a partisan of Durward's party. This can be explained by the fact that although most of his territories lay in Douglasdale, through his wife, Constance, he had obtained the rich Manor of Fawdon in Northumberland and it would do well to keep English Royal favour.David Hume of Godscroft, the arch-panegyricist of the House of Douglas, states that Longleg married Marjorie, Countess of Carrick and had by her two sons and a daughter, the daughter inheriting the Earldom of Carrick. Marjorie went on to marry Robert the Bruce, father to King Robert I of Scotland; this, however, does not make any sense historically.
William Longleg, Lord of Douglas (died c. 1274) married Constance Battail of Fawdon, and had two sons and a daughter:
Hugh I, Lord of Douglas (died c. 1274)
William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas (1240–1298)

1135 ," Anne Elliot is the protagonist of Jane Austen's sixth and last completed novel, Persuasion (1817).
Anne Elliot was persuaded, when she was 20 years old, to break off her engagement with Frederick Wentworth, a promising young lieutenant in the Royal Navy but a commoner without fortune, and she has never married. Lonely, unloved by a stuck-up and pretentious father and older sister, little considered by a family circle incapable of recognising her value, she leads a dull life of an almost-old maid. And yet here it is that, 8 years after the naval war with France ended, in September 1814, the young man whom she has never forgotten returns to England, having earned epaulettes, prestige and fortune in the navy. The first contacts are painful. He has retained an image of her as a person too easily influenced and she sees clearly that he is still angry with her. But at age 27, she has matured and gained enough independence from her family and social circle to choose her friends and her future.
The posthumous novel by Jane Austen presents the portrait of an independent spirit, a young, intelligent and melancholic woman, sensitive and attentive to others, who regains her self-confidence when she is given a second chance to find happiness, a very different happiness from other Austenian heroines, since she marries neither a land owner nor a clergyman, but a ship's captain. She would be 'proud of being the wife of a sailor' but she would also know its anxieties and its sorrows. She is considered the most lucid and responsible Austenian heroine and the reader is privy in a special way to her thoughts, which are of an exactitude and a perceptiveness which are without parallel in the heroines of previous novels.

1151 ," The Battles of the Kinarot Valley (Hebrew: הַמַּעֲרָכָה בְּבִקְעַת כִּנָּרוֹת‎, HaMa'arakha BeBik'at Kinarot), is a collective name for a series of military engagements between the Haganah and the Syrian army during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, fought between May 15–22, 1948 in the Kinarot Valley. It includes two main sites: the Battle of Degania–Samakh (Tzemah), and battles near Masada–Sha'ar HaGolan. The engagements were part of the battles of the Jordan Valley, which also saw fighting against Transjordan in the area of Gesher.
The battles took place approximately 24 hours after the Israeli declaration of independence, when Syria shelled Ein Gev on the night of May 15–16. This was the first military engagement between Israel and Syria. On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Samakh (Tzemah), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet. After reaching a stalemate, they retreated to their initial position in Tel al-Qasr, where they remained until the end of the war.
The campaign was perceived as a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command and the birth of heroic tales in Israel. However, Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel, such as the retreat from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan.

1152 ," The geographical mile is a unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc along the Earth's equator.  For the 1924 International Spheroid this equalled 1855.4 metres. The American Practical Navigator 2017 defines the geographical mile as 6087.08 feet (1855.342 m). Greater precision depends more on choice of ellipsoid than on more careful measurement: the length of the equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is 40075016.6856 m which makes the geographical mile 1855.3248 m, while the IERS Conventions (2010) takes the equator to be 40075020.4555 m making the geographical mile 1855.3250 m, 0.2 millimetres longer. In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles.
The shape of the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, which results in the Earth's circumference being 0.168% larger when measured around the equator as compared to through the poles. The geographical mile is slightly larger than the nautical mile (which was historically linked to the circumference measured through both poles); one geographic mile is equivalent to approximately 1.00178 nautical miles.

1155 ," Masséna was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy, built in the 1890s. She was a member of a group of five broadly similar battleships, along with Charles Martel, Jauréguiberry, Bouvet, and Carnot, that were ordered in response to the British Royal Sovereign class. She was named in honour of Marshal of France André Masséna. Masséna significantly exceeded her design weight and suffered from serious stability problems that inhibited accurate firing of her guns; as a result, she was considered to be an unsuccessful design.
Masséna served in both the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons during her career, which included a period as the flagship of the Northern Squadron. She was withdrawn from service before the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The following year, she was hulked at Toulon. She was later towed to Cape Helles at the end of the Gallipoli peninsula where on 9 November 1915 she was scuttled to create a breakwater to protect the evacuation of the Allied expeditionary force withdrawing from the Gallipoli Campaign.

1157 ," Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), birth name Lu Jian (Chinese: 陸堅; pinyin: Lù Jiān), was Chinese painter, poet, and writer during the late Song dynasty in Changshu, Jiangsu. He was the oldest of the 'Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty'.
At the age of 10, the Song fell to the Mongol founders of the Yuan Dynasty and he, like many other Chinese scholars of the time, found his path to officialdom and a good career severely limited. 'He was first an unranked ling-shih at a Surveillance Office in the Chiang-che Branch Secretariat (Province), probably engaged in some sort of land tax supervision. Later he served as a secretary in the metropolitan Censorate where he was unfortunately involved in the slander case of a minister, Chang Lu. He seems to have spent quite some time in jail before retreating into Taoism [as did many others of the age--another was the famous painter Ni Zan], completely disillusioned.' He spent his last years in the Fu-ch'un mountains near Hangzhou devoting himself to Taoism, where around 1350 he completed one of his most famous, and arguably greatest, works, Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.
In art he rejected the landscape conventions of his era's Academy, but is now regarded as one of the great literati painters. Art historian James Cahill identified Huang Gongwang as the artist who 'most decisively altered the course of landscape painting, creating models that would have a profound effect on landscapists of later centuries.' One of Huang Gongwang's strongest influences was his technique of using very dry brush strokes together with light ink washes (when colour is applied to a specific area using a soft-haired brush with wide strokes that blend them together into a unified wash) to build up his landscape paintings. He also wrote a treatise on landscape painting, Secrets of Landscape Painting (寫山水訣, Xiě Shānshuǐ Jué).
As was typical for Chinese scholar-officials of his era, he also wrote poetry and had some talent for music. "

1201 ," In economics and political science, fiscal policy is  the use of government revenue collection (taxes or tax cuts) and expenditure (spending) to influence a country's economy. The use of government revenues and expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed as a result of the Great Depression, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unpopular. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose Keynesian economics theorized that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influences aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country's government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation (which is considered 'healthy' at the level in the range 2%–3%) and to increase employment. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%–3% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%–5%. This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilize the economy over the course of the business cycle.Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including:

aggregate demand and the level of economic activity
saving and investment
income distribution
allocation of resources.Fiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy, in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply, interest rates and is often administered by a country's central bank. Both fiscal and monetary policies influence a country's economic performance. "

1299 ," The Rotores de Portugal (Portuguese for 'Rotors of Portugal') is a helicopter flight demonstration team created in 1976, operated by Esquadra 552 (Squadron 552) of the Portuguese Air Force, based in No 11 Air Base, Beja. They are the national helicopter display team of Portugal and use three Sud Aviation Alouette III.
In 1976, the aerobatic team Rotores de Portugal was created by order of the Air Force Chief of Staff (CEMFA) to represent the Portuguese Air Force in several festivals all over the country. The team operated for 18 years while integrated with the 102 Squadron Panchos, and flew a total of 41 demonstrations.
On the fifty-third anniversary of the Air Force, in 2005, the Rotores de Portugal were reactivated as part of the 552 Squadron, based at Beja Air Base.
By that time, a special colourful livery was applied to the helicopters operated by the Rotores de Portugal, which included the national colours and the name of the team. As these helicopters were not exclusively used by the team, it started to be a common sight to see Alouette III sporting the special livery while performing the most varied missions, from search and rescue to airmobile assaults exercises. Even after the suspension of the Rotores de Portugal activity, these helicopters continued to sport their respective livery.
The last performing of the Rotores de Portugal occurred in 2010, with the team being currently inactive. Meanwhile, the Portuguese Air Force initiated the deactivation of their remaining Alouette III helicopters, which are being replaced by a smaller number of AgustaWestland AW119 Koala. "

1328 ," Mer Bleue Bog is a 33.43 km2 (12.91 sq mi) protected area east of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Its main feature is a sphagnum bog that is situated in an ancient channel of the Ottawa River and is a remarkable boreal-like ecosystem normally not found this far south. Stunted black spruce, tamarack, bog rosemary, blueberry, and cottongrass are some of the unusual species that have adapted to the acidic waters of the bog.
The area provides habitat for many species, including beaver, muskrat, waterfowl, and the rare spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata). A 1.2 km boardwalk allows visitors to explore a section of the bog. There are hiking trails that follow raised areas along the edges of the bog and cross-country skiing trails for use in winter. The conservation area is managed by the National Capital Commission.
The value of this unique wetland was not always recognized. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force used this area for bombing practice. Now, this area has been designated as a Wetland of International Significance under the Ramsar Convention since October 1995, and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest since 2011.The name 'Mer Bleue' (French, meaning 'blue sea') is thought to describe the bog's appearance when it is covered in morning fog.

1333 ," Greece has many islands, with estimates ranging from somewhere around 1,200 to 6,000, depending on the minimum size to take into account. The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166 and 227.The largest Greek island by area is Crete, located at the southern edge of the Aegean Sea. The second largest island is Euboea, which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide Euripus Strait, and is administered as part of the Central Greece region. After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands, Lesbos and Rhodes, the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller.
The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters:  the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens; the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the Sporades, a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the Ionian Islands, chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea. Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping.
This article excludes the Peloponnese, which has technically been an island since the construction of the Corinth Canal in 1893, but is rarely considered to be an island. "

1336 ," Diaspore , also known as diasporite, empholite, kayserite, or tanatarite, is an aluminium oxide hydroxide mineral, α-AlO(OH), crystallizing in the orthorhombic system and isomorphous with goethite. It occurs sometimes as flattened crystals, but usually as lamellar or scaly masses, the flattened surface being a direction of perfect cleavage on which the lustre is markedly pearly in character. It is colorless or greyish-white, yellowish, sometimes violet in color, and varies from translucent to transparent. It may be readily distinguished from other colorless transparent minerals with a perfect cleavage and pearly luster—like mica, talc, brucite, and gypsum— by its greater hardness of 6.5 - 7. The specific gravity is 3.4. When heated before the blowpipe it decrepitates violently, breaking up into white pearly scales.The mineral occurs as an alteration product of corundum or emery and is found in granular limestone and other crystalline rocks. Well-developed crystals are found in the emery deposits of the Urals and at Chester, Massachusetts, and in kaolin at Schemnitz in Hungary. If obtainable in large quantity, it would be of economic importance as a source of aluminium.Diaspore, along with gibbsite and boehmite, is a major component of the aluminium ore bauxite.It was first described in 1801 for an occurrence in Mramorsk Zavod, Sverdlovskaya Oblast, Middle Urals, Russia. The name, which was coined by René Just Haüy, is from the Greek for διασπείρειν, to scatter, in allusion to its decrepitation on heating.Csarite, ottomanite, and zultanite are trade names for gem-quality diaspore (also known as Turkish diaspore) from the İlbir Mountains of southwest Turkey.

In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were one of the first custom media and remain typical of the genre. While other channels have had significant success, the customer magazine is the most successful example of the genre.Typically, custom media is sponsored by a single marketer (a company, brand, association or institution) and is designed to reach a tightly focused audience of customers, members, alumni or other constituency. Custom media can be produced 'in-house' by such organizations. Over the past two decades, a growing number of specialized publishing and media firms have emerged, called 'custom media' or 'custom publishing' companies in the US, and 'customer publishers'' or ''publishing agencies' in the UK. Like advertising and other marketing services firms, the companies or divisions of traditional media companies, provide professional marketing and communications services to clients for a fee. Such out-sourced services can be limited to design and editorial responsibilities or include the complete production and distribution process. In addition, many of the companies sell advertising space within custom publications to third parties; this subsizes the cost of publication; creates a more authentic editorial environment; and allows third parties to purchase and publicizes an association with the media's sponsor, while reaching that sponsor's customers (e.g. food suppliers may purchase advertising space within a supermarket's custom media).Custom media aims to build a relationship of trust and loyalty with the sponsor's customers, so they regard the sponsor as the vendor of choice when they make purchases. This is accomplished by providing information and, often, advice, that meets the needs and suits the preferences of the sponsor's target  market. It serves the interests of the audience, rather than overtly plugging products and services the way ads do.

1385 ," Resource nationalism is the tendency of people and governments to assert control over natural resources located on their territory. As a result, resource nationalism conflicts with the interests of multinational corporations.
The approach of peak oil has led many governments to take ownership or control of fossil fuel reservoirs for strategic and economic reasons, although resource nationalism applies to other resources, such as metals, or in less developed nations, mining investment.
It is mainly enforced as an economic policy (usually in populist governments) that relies on state ownership or control of natural resources located on their territories to advance political, social or industrial objectives. This emphasizes that resources belong to the people of the country in question first and foremost, and that state employment is the best manager of resources against privatization. 
A recent tide of resource nationalism appeared during the period of economic liberalisation in Latin America in the 1990s, with populations and governments looking for independence of the country in terms of export and resources. An example includes the Cochabamba Water War, a series of protests against privatization of the city's water supply that took place in Bolivia. As a result, less than six months later the government cancelled the contract. 
Governments that have adopted elements of resource nationalism include Bolivia under Evo Morales, Argentina under Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Venezuela under Hugo Chávez. "

Akech was the second wife of Rwoth Nyabongo, ruler of the chiefdom of Paroketu. The royal line of succession had up until this point been patrilineal, and in due course Nyabongo would have been succeeded by Jobi, the eldest son of Akura, his senior wife. Akech, however, enjoyed a position in religious leadership, which augmented her royal standing, and she used this to consolidate her own power; consequently, by 1760 she had risen to get political prominence not only as the wife of the chief and as a ritual leader, but as mother of the successor to the throne. Her son Roketu later came to power; his people then came to be known as the Pa-Akech, or 'people of Akech', recognizing the fact that she had founded a ruling dynasty. Little else is recorded of Akech, save that she was a member of a clan of the Bunyoro. "

1432 ," Michael G. Inay (1944–2000) was the founder of the Filipino martial art of Inayan Eskrima.
He studied privately under the tutelage of two great Eskrima masters, Max Sarmiento and Angel Cabales. It was Mike Inay who proposed to Angel Cabales the formation of an organization to preserve and promote the Cabales Serrada style of Eskrima. It was this and many other contributions that made Mangisursuro Mike Inay a prominent figure in the Stockton, California Eskrima scene. With Mr. Inay's help, Mr. Cabales formed the first Cabales Serrada association. Mr. Inay also developed a ranking structure for the system.
He later co-founded the West Coast Eskrima Society with its first chairman, Max Sarmiento, in 1979. The West Coast Eskrima Society was formally inaugurated in Los Gatos, California in Mr. Inay's home. The West Coast Eskrima Society was founded in the hopes of preserving, propagating, and promoting the Filipino martial arts. The society was able to unite several Filipino masters under one organization. Among the notable Eskrima masters who joined it were: Max Sarmiento, Mike Inay, Jimmy Tacosa, Jeffrey Elliott, Sam Tendencia, Dentoy Revillar, Gilbert Tenio, Leo Giron, Narrie Babao, Dan Inosanto, and Richard Bustillo.
Inay began teaching law enforcement throughout the United States and became known in the law enforcement community. He also traveled abroad to conduct seminars and clinics on his personal style, Inayan Eskrima, in England, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Canada and Australia.
At the request of a large Midwest law enforcement organization, he developed a law enforcement knife defense program called 'Spontaneous Knife Defense' or 'Reactive Knife Defense'. He also appeared on Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).
During this period, he also developed and refined the Inayan System of Eskrima. Inayan Eskrima comprises seven distinct styles of Eskrima. Each of these styles has a complete set of basic, intermediate, and advanced techniques and concepts that make them viable independent of one other.
Inay placed a learning structure over these styles and a ranking system for grading. He elected to call all of the styles he teaches 'Inayan' to avoid confusion with other teachers and styles that might have the same or similar names. This also reduced the amount of controversy and claims of validity others could or could not profess with regard to 'Inayan' Eskrima.
Inay developed several courses dealing with pressure-sensitive nerve areas, riot baton, and advanced knife training. He also developed the use of the knife as an alternative weapon for executive protection in instances where a firearm is not warranted or safe to use.
Mike Inay died in 2000 teaching Inayan Eskrima. While alive and head of the system he was referred to by his unofficial title Suro; since his death he is referred to as Mangisursuro, his official title. "

In spite of this close association, the chough population experienced a severe decline in Cornwall through the 20th century, and had not been seen in the county since the early 1970s. In 2001, however, up to five birds were seen on The Lizard, thought to have come from Ireland. This pioneer population rapidly grew, with their offspring reaching nearly twenty birds. Since then, the Operation has made several efforts to keep this population viable by monitoring the nesting areas, promoting awareness of the cultural and environmental importance of the species to Cornwall and by releasing birds to further enlarge the genetic pool of the pioneer communities.Dr Richard Meyer's thesis 'The Feeding Ecology of the Red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) in West Wales and the Feasibility of Re-establishment in Cornwall' is available online.

She has not been seen since.At the time, Whitton, who had a criminal record, was jobless, addicted to heroin and crystal methamphetamine, and in a difficult relationship with her boyfriend, Ashley Caudle, who was at the Walmart with her. He noted her failure to return that night, going to a nearby restaurant where she had worked to look for her, but did not contact the police or her family. Whitton's mother, who was used to her frequent and sometimes lengthy unexplained absences, went to the police in January 2014.The investigation is continuing, but while police say new leads come regularly, none of them have proven useful. Due to Caudle's criminal history, false statements about events that night he made later, and his failure to inform authorities or Whitton's family when he was unable to locate her, he is considered a person of interest.  Currently serving a lengthy prison sentence for drug and gun charges, he denies any involvement in Whitton's disappearance or knowledge of her whereabouts.
In 2016, journalist Tom Junod wrote an article about the case in Esquire, seeing the media silence on Whitton's case as an exception to what is called missing white woman syndrome. While Whitton is white, her troubled past and criminal record made her a less attractive subject to report on, he noted; her mother complained that some television shows that devote airtime to these cases had told her they were not interested in her daughter's disappearance. Junod also reported that Whitton's half-brother Blake said he received a phone call from her in January 2014, almost four months after she was last seen.

1530 ," Juan Cespedes Uribe Tena (born March 22, 1979) is a Dominican former professional baseball infielder. He played shortstop, third base and second base during his career in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and Cleveland Indians. He bats and throws right-handed.
Uribe began his professional career in 1997 when he was signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and was traded to the Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average with runners in scoring position (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.
In 2009, Uribe signed with the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe was traded to the Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5. "

1534 ," In computer science, read-copy-update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that avoids the use of lock primitives while multiple threads concurrently read and update elements that are linked through pointers and that belong to shared data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, hash tables).Whenever a thread is inserting or deleting elements of data structures in shared memory, all readers are guaranteed to see and traverse either the older or the new structure, therefore avoiding inconsistencies (e.g., dereferencing null pointers).It is used when performance of reads is crucial and is an example of space–time tradeoff, enabling fast operations at the cost of more space. This makes all readers proceed as if there were no synchronization involved, hence they will be fast, but also making updates more difficult. "

1539 ," Starachowice [staraxɔˈvʲit͡sɛ] (listen) is a town in south-central Poland (historic Lesser Poland), with 49,513 inhabitants (31.12.2017). Starachowice is situated in the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (since 1999); it was formerly in the Kielce Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Starachowice County. It is situated upon the River Kamienna, a tributary of the Vistula River, among hills and forests.
In the location of present-day Starachowice, a forge existed, which in the 16th century belonged to the Starzechowski family (most probably, the name of the town comes from this family). A settlement, which was built around the forge, belonged until 1817 to the Cistercians from Wąchock Abbey, located nearby. It was the monks who in 1789 initiated construction of a blast furnace (see also Old-Polish Industrial Region). In 1815, the furnace was taken over by the government of Congress Poland, and in the following years, the industrial settlement of Starachowice emerged as main center of metallurgy. According to a plan devised by Stanisław Staszic, metal industry was developed along the Kamienna river, and the settlement of Starachowice was its center.
After Poland regained independence in 1918, the government in Warsaw decided to build an arms factory in Starachowice. On October 12, 1920, The Society of Starachowice Mining Company signed a contract with Main Office of Supplying the Army. Soon afterwards, works on construction of artillery ammunition factory began. Zakłady Starachowickie (Starachowice Works), which was an industrial complex including ammunition factory, artillery equipment factory and iron works, was main Poland’s producer of such materiel. It also manufactured Bofors 37 mm guns, used by the Polish Army in 1939. The very town of Starachowice was not created until April 1, 1939, when the ancient town of Wierzbnik (founded 1624) was merged with the settlement of Starachowice Fabryczne and the village of Starachowice Górne. At first, the new town was named Starachowice-Wierzbnik, and in 1952 the name was changed into Starachowice.
During the Holocaust, the ghetto in Wierzbnik was liquidated on October 27, 1942, and many of its prisoners were sent to the death camp Treblinka. The remaining Jewish residents of Starachowice and Wierzbnik were sent to labor camps in the vicinity. Those camps were liquidated in the summer of 1944.  The remaining survivors were deported to Auschwitz where many of them met their deaths at the hands of the Schutzstaffel. There was a munition plant there where Jewish slave labor was used.

During World War II, Starachowice was an important center of the Home Army, where units of Jan Piwnik and Antoni Heda operated. After the war, the town prospered as an important industrial center. Besides Starachowice Works, truck producer FSC Star was opened in 1948. A Star truck was used as the basis for the first Popemobile for Pope John Paul II's during his first visit to his home country as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1979). When capitalist system was reintroduced in 1989, the situation in Starachowice worsened, and unemployment grew drastically. The town currently has a special economy zone with lower tax rates to help the settlement of new industry. "

1545 ," The Statue of Sobekneferu was a sculpture of the Ancient Egyptian queen Sobekneferu (about 1800 BC), who reigned during the 12th dynasty.
The bust with the ruler's preserved face is the first known statue of the queen with a face. The sculpture was kept in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, but was lost in World War II. The bust was bought in 1899 (inventory no. 14475). The bust was about 14 cm high and made of greywacke. The identity of the woman shown was for a long time unknown, as the piece is uninscribed. The face of the woman shows clearly signs of age and dates therefore stylistically to the late Middle Kingdom, when most sculptures show people no longer ageless young as in other periods of Egyptian history. Today, the bust is known from photographic images, and also from preserved plaster casts.
The Egyptologist Biri Fay was able to locate the remaining part of the statue. It is now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA 24.742, 21.4 cm high), but was once found in the temple of Taharqa in the Nubian fortress of Semna. The lower part of the statue is also uninscribed but shows on the throne the hieroglyphic signs uniting the two lands (zm3-t3wy). This is a royal symbol and only attested for kings. Therefore, this (now photographically united) statue shows a woman that ruled as king and must belong to Sobekneferu, the only ruling queen of the late Middle Kingdom. There are several statues known belonging to this ruling queen. However, each one is headless. "

1556 ," A yacht  is a sail or power vessel used for pleasure, cruising, or racing. There is no standard definition, so the term applies to such vessels that have a cabin with amenities that accommodate overnight use. To be termed a yacht, as opposed to a boat, such a pleasure vessel is likely to be at least 33 feet (10 m) in length and have been judged to have good aesthetic qualities.The Commercial Yacht Code classifies yachts 79 ft (24 m) and over as large. Such yachts typically require a hired crew and have higher construction standards. Further classifications for large yachts are: commercial—carrying no more than 12 passengers, private—solely for the pleasure of the owner and guests, or by flag, the country under which it is registered. A superyacht (sometimes megayacht) generally refers to any yacht (sail or power) longer than 131 ft (40 m).Racing yachts are designed to emphasize performance over comfort.

1558 ," Rinaldo degli Albizzi (1370–1442) was an Italian nobleman, a member of the Florentine family of the Albizzi. Together with Palla Strozzi, he was the main opponent of Cosimo de' Medici's rise in Florence.
Rinaldo entered into public service for the Florence Republic in 1399 as a diplomat under the oligarchy rule of his father Maso degli Albizzi.  He served on several dozen official diplomatic missions first locally in towns such as Arezzo and Cortona then increasing assignments to Pisa, Lucca, Naples and Rome.  During the height of his diplomatic duties he was the main diplomat for Florence and was particularly active in ecclesiastic diplomacy.
Upon his father's death in 1417, Rinaldo rose to unofficial second in command of the oligarchy under his father's long-time friend, Niccolo da Uzzano.   He would later rise to the leadership position when Uzzano died in 1431.
After the Volterran revolt against Florence in 1428, Rinaldo degli Albizzi was sent to 'reacquire' Volterra from rebels led by priors and Giovanni di Contugi. Afterwards, Rinaldo incited Niccolò Fortebraccio to 'attack the Lucchese under cover of some fictitious quarrel', an action that led Florence to attempt the conquest of Lucca. During this campaign, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, while serving as War Commissioner under the Ten of War, was accused of attempting to increase his own wealth through sacking. He was eventually removed from his position and recalled to Florence.
Later, in 1433, Rinaldo convinced several prominent nobles to strike out against Cosimo de' Medici, who he feared was getting too powerful. Eventually, Rinaldo helped Bernardo Guadagni, a candidate for a position among the Signori, pay off his debts, which had been disqualifying him from running for office. Guadagni won the position of Gonfaloniere of Justice. Through Guadagni, Rinaldo summoned Cosimo to the palace, where he was captured. After a short trial, Cosimo was sentenced to 20 years' exile from Florence, although Rinaldo sought the death penalty.
However, with the downturn of Florentine fortunes in the war with Milan, Cosimo returned with popular acclamation barely a year later, and Rinaldo was in his turn exiled. 
Rinaldo tried several times while in exile to convince The Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, to intervene and restore him to power in Florence.  These hopes were finally ended with the Florentine victory at The Battle of Anghiari.
He died at Ancona in 1442 after a trip to Jerusalem. "

1570 ," Ola Bøe (July 10, 1910 – September 7, 1986) was a Norwegian fiddler.
Ola Bøe was born in the municipality of Vestre Slidre in Oppland county, Norway, the son of Per Person Bøe (1859–1922) and Rangdi Jakobsdotter (1867–1934). His father played the Hardanger fiddle but died when Ola was twelve years old. As a result, he learned many tunes from his mother, who was good at humming dance tunes. He also learned tunes from his elder brother Jørgen (1904–1986), and considered himself a student of Andris Øde, Alf Moe, and Olav Moe.Bøe moved to Oslo in 1935 and soon became an important fiddler in the folk music scene there. For many years, he regularly played with the Valdres Fiddling Group (Norwegian: Valdreslaget) and was also active in the Folk Music Association (Norwegian: Laget for folkemusikk). The fiddlers that came to learn from him included Bernt Balchen Jr., Trygve Bolstad, and Harald Røine. He had a personal style of playing, and often used a homemade fiddle. He was considered a very talented dance fiddler, although it could take some time for him to really get warmed up. He knew many old tunes played using less common tunings, and he played in an older style. He also used a fingering technique that was difficult to imitate.
He won the national fiddling competition (Norwegian: Landskappleiken) held at Geilo in 1969, playing a fiddle that he had borrowed from Odd Bakkerud. Bøe played extensively for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) from 1953 onward, and there are many recordings of his playing. He was made an honorary member of the Folk Music Association and received the Vestre Slidre cultural award in 1982.
Bøe resided at Nadderud and died in Bærum. "

1572 ," In quantum mechanics, the expectation value is the probabilistic expected value of the result (measurement) of an experiment.

1626 ," The Chrism Mass is a religious service held in Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism.Holy Thursday is notable for being the day on which the Chrism Mass is celebrated in each diocese. The Chrism Mass is one of the most solemn and important liturgies of the liturgical year. Usually held in the diocesean cathedral, it is generally held on the morning of Holy Thursday, but may in some dioceses take place on another day during Holy Week. It is often the largest annual gathering of clergy and faithful held in most dioceses. In some dioceses, attendance is sufficiently significant that, due to limited seating, tickets are distributed to parishes. The Mass is a celebration of the institution of the priesthood with Jesus' words at the Last Supper, 'Do this in memory of me.' During the Mass, those present are called to renew their baptismal promises; priests/ministers and deacons also reaffirm their ministry by renewing the promises made at their ordination.The Mass takes its name from the blessing of the holy oils used in the sacraments throughout the year, which are then given to priests/ministers to take back to their parishes. The Rite of Reception of the Oils by representatives of the diocesan parishes is a sign of each parish's unity with the Bishop and the diocesan Church. Whenever the holy oils are used, the ministry of the bishop who consecrated them is symbolically present. The oils distributed are meant to last all year, although extra oil is also blessed during the Mass and is kept at the cathedral as a reserve if a parish runs out.The service is a 1967 restoration of the rite recorded in the early 200s by the historian Hippolytus who writes of a ceremony taking place during the Easter Vigil at which two holy oils were blessed and one was consecrated. In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Easter Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. The change took place, partly, because of the large crowds that assembled for the Easter Vigil, but also to emphasize Christ's institution of this ordained priesthood at Holy Thursday's Last Supper. In the decree renewing this rite Pope Paul VI said:“The Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop’s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.”The Holy Oils are:

Chrism – used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.
the oil of catechumens – also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and
the oil of the sick – used in the rite of the Anointing of the Sick
The oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming Holy Saturday at the Easter Vigil, for the baptism and confirmation of those entering the church.
While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply 'blessed,' the Sacred Chrism is 'consecrated,'. Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the 'odor of sanctity' to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit...' The priests concelebrating the Mass extend their hands toward the vessel containing the chrism and say the prayer of consecration silently as the bishop pronounces it over the chrism. "

Born in Cripple Creek, Colorado, Robertson attended the University of Utah. He batted and threw right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and weighed 184 pounds (83 kg).
He was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent in 1954 but was acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in the December 1956 minor league draft.  He spent four seasons in the Braves' system without reaching the Triple-A level.  Then, at the close of spring training in 1961, he was traded to the Cubs with fellow infielder Andre Rodgers for pitchers Moe Drabowsky and Seth Morehead.
Rodgers was the Cubs' starting shortstop in both 1961 and 1962.  Most of Robertson's big-league service time came when Rodgers was injured in May 1962.  He started five games at shortstop (and one at third base) between May 11–19, and notched two hits in 19 total at bats. Both safeties came on the same day, May 12 against the Philadelphia Phillies at Wrigley Field.  The Cubs traded Robertson to the St. Louis Cardinals June 5, but he never appeared in a big-league game for the Redbirds. He spent the rest of the 1962 campaign, his last in baseball, in the minor leagues.

1808 ," Feng Menglong (1574–1646), courtesy names Youlong (猶龍), Gongyu (公魚), Ziyou (子猶), or Eryou (耳猶), was a Chinese historian, novelist, and poet of the late Ming Dynasty. He was born in Changzhou County (長洲縣, not Changzhou), now part of Suzhou, in Jiangsu Province.Feng was born into a scholar-bureaucrat gentry household, where he and his brothers Feng Menggui (馮夢桂) and Feng Mengxiong (馮夢熊) were educated in the classics and the traditional arts of the gentleman. He and his brothers, all well-known as accomplished writers, artists, and poets, became known collectively as the 'Three Fengs of the Wu Area' (吳下三馮).  In spite of his literary talent and his zeal for scholarship from a young age, Feng sat the imperial civil service examinations many times without success, eventually giving up and making a living as a tutor and teacher.
In 1626, he narrowly avoided punishment after being implicated as an associate of Zhou Shunchang (周順昌), who was framed and purged by the corrupt eunuch Wei Zhongxian.  Appalled by the injustice, he resolved to complete his trilogy of vernacular Chinese short story collections: Stories to Instruct the World, Stories to Caution the World, and Stories to Awaken the World  (喻世明言, 警世通言, and 醒世恆言).
In recognition of his reputation as a writer, Feng was finally awarded the gongsheng degree in 1630 at the age of fifty-seven.  In the subsequent year, he received his first government post as instructor of Dantu County (丹徒縣, today Zhenjiang, Jiangsu).  In 1634, he was appointed magistrate of Shouning County (壽寧) in Fujian.

He died in despair in 1646 as the Ming dynasty continued to collapse.  Some works indicate or imply that he was killed by Qing soldiers.
Feng's literary output consisted of the compilation of histories and local gazettes, the retelling of folktales and stories from antiquity in the form of short stories and plays, and the authorship of vernacular Chinese novels. Two of his noteworthy works are the Qing Shi (History of Love, 情史), an anthology of classical love stories, and the shenmo novel Pingyao Zhuan. In 1620 he published the Illustrious Words to Instruct the World (喻世明言 Yushi Mingyan), or Stories Old and New, the first part of his well-known trilogy.Feng was a proponent of the school of Li Zhi, which supported the importance of human feelings and behavior in literature.

1819 ," The Scitovsky paradox is a paradox in welfare economics which is resolved by stating that there is no increase in social welfare by a return to the original part of the losers. It is named after the Hungarian born American economist, Tibor Scitovsky.
According to Scitovsky, Kaldor-Hicks criterion involves contradictory and inconsistent results. What Scitovsky demonstrated was it is possible that if an allocation A is deemed superior to another allocation B by the Kaldor compensation criteria, then by a subsequent set of moves by the same criteria, we can prove that B is also superior to A.
The paradox occurs when the gainer from the change of allocation A to allocation B can compensate the loser for making the change, but the loser could also then compensate the gainer for going back to the original position. Scitovsky pointed out that to get at the correct criterion of welfare we must remove this contradiction. He has therefore offered his own criterion called the “Scitovsky Double criterion”.The Scitovsky criterion was developed by Tibor Scitovsky in his paper “A Note on Welfare Propositions in Economics”, 1941.

It is worn by Christians in Brazil, especially Catholics, as a symbol of the commitment of their churches to the poor.The ring originated in the Brazilian Empire, when jewelry made of gold and other precious metals were used ostentatiously by members of the ruling elite to flaunt their wealth and power. Afro-Brazilian slaves and Native Brazilians, unable to afford such metals for making their own jewelry, created the tucum ring to symbolize marriage, friendship, and their struggle for liberation. It was a clandestine symbol whose meaning only they understood.

More recently, the usage of the tucum ring was revived by Christians linked to liberation theology, in order to symbolize the alliance of their churches with the poor and oppressed people of Latin America, especially by Catholics after the Second Vatican Council and the Latin American Episcopal Conferences of Medellín and Puebla.In 1994, the tucum ring was the subject of a documentary of the same name directed by Conrad Berning. In the film, Catholic bishop Pedro Casaldáliga, one of the interviewees, said the following about the usage of the ring:
'This ring is made from a palm tree in the Amazon. It is a sign of the alliance with the indigenous cause and with popular causes. Those who carry this ring took these causes as their own. And its consequences. Would you use the ring? Look, this commits you, you know? Many, because of this commitment, were killed.' "

1851 ," Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss. Symptoms may also include increased hunger, feeling tired, and sores that do not heal. Often symptoms come on slowly. Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations. The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise. Some people are more genetically at risk than others.Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes. In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1C).Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating properly. Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes. If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended. Many people may eventually also require insulin injections. In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels is advised; however, this may not be needed in those taking pills. Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015 there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases described. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.

Developing nations with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations, and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.

1888 ," Jesse Bowman Aikin (1808–1900) was a shape note 'singing master', and compiler of the shape note tunebook The Christian Minstrel. He was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania and lived on a farm in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Aikin, a member of the Church of the Brethren, was the first to successfully produce a song book (The Christian Minstrel) with a seven-shape note system, in 1846. He vigorously defended his 'invention' and his patent, which included the elimination of bass and treble clefs and the simplification of time signatures. After the influential Ruebush & Kieffer Publishing Company began using his notehead shapes around 1876 (previously they used Funk's shapes), the Aikin shapes eventually became the prevailing standard in shape note and gospel music publication, although few other compilers adopted his other innovations.
Aikin's names for the notes were originally written: Doe Ray Mee Faw Sole Law See. All the note stems pointed downwards, and the stems for Doe, Ray, and See were placed centrally on the shape, rather than to the side. These conventions were discarded by later users of his system, so as not to deviate so much from standard notation. The name See was also changed to Ti (as used in the Tonic sol-fa system), so as not to be confused with a sharpened Sol.
Today Aikin's system is still in use, though it is often referred to as the Aiken system, a spelling error introduced by George Pullen Jackson and perpetuated by the Sibelius music notation program. "

Genetic analysis showed in 2014 that two previously-described species—C. subcyanites and C. pseudocyanites—lay within the concept of C. cyanites, but conversely revealed three distinct lineages, with two new species—C. boreicyanites and C. violaceorubens—described.The fruitbodies of this fungus have convex caps, with diameters typically in the range 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in), and various shades of violet, brown or grey. They are slimy when young, and later have brown scales. The pale purple stipe is bulbous, 9–15 cm (3.5–5.9 in) in height and 2–3.5 cm (0.79–1.38 in) in width. The flesh is purple, but turns blood red when bruised or cut. The gills on the cap underside have an adnate attachment to the stipe and purple color; later, the deepens to rusty brown as the spores mature. The smell has been described as pleasant and fruity. The lemon-shaped spores measure 8–11.5 by 5–6.5 µm. C. boreicyanites and C. violaceorubens have smaller and larger spores respectively. C. violaceorubens has a dark purple-brown cap, while that of C. boreicyanites is more bluish.Cortinarius cyanites is found in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests in southern Finland, central Sweden southwards into France.Cortinarius cyanites is not edible.

1899 ," Agriculture in Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory, is a small industry that is heavily influenced by the volcanic activity of the Soufrière Hills. Historically a major producer of sugar and tobacco, the eruptions of the Soufrière Hills between 1995 and 1997 severely damaged infrastructure across a large part of the island. Much of the arable land was destroyed during eruptions or now falls within an 'exclusion zone', leaving only limited sections on the northern region of the island usable for cultivation.
Agriculture plays little role in the island's economy, as most of the economic activity since the eruptions is generated by service jobs (tourism, government) and construction. Regardless, the government of Montserrat has committed to investing in new technology to revive the agricultural industry of the island; so that it is more self-sustainable and less reliant on food imports.

It received high ratings and proved to be one of the rare successes for RTL Televizija in its first six months on Croatian television markets.
Despite the huge commercial success and becoming a cultural phenomenon of its season, the first season was subjected to much criticism. Andrija Hebrang, Croatian health minister at the time, complained about contestants smoking while the programme on air, which was against Croatian laws.  In response to this, later live broadcasts were time-delayed.  The show also created minor controversy due to a single homophobic statement ('If I knew I had a fag friend, I would kill him. I would kill him') made by Zdravko Lamot.Other critics complained about lack of diversity among contestants who didn't represent the average of Croatian population. They were mostly all in the mid-20s, attending college, having a liberal mindset and coming from well-to-do or upper-middle-class families. Another exception was Saša Tkalčević, a 32-year-old biker from Bjelovar, husband and father of two children.

1945 ," Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss.  It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.
An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or underwriter.  A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss.  The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.
The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.

The archetype of the amicable Frenchman, the marquis of Croismare earned the nickname 'The Philosopher' for giving up ambition early in life. Alternatively, very devout, strong-minded or indifferent, he fell in love with a Protestant girl of his countryside, Suzanne Davy de La Pailleterie. His fervor for the Catholic religion was such that he made Suzanne La Pailleterie his proselyte. Her conversion, effected on 30 October 1734 at Cagny, is perhaps the only one he achieved. After his marriage, on 3 August 1735, she gave him two sons and a daughter. Having lost her early, he nearly died of grief.
After his wife's death, he left his land of Lasson, near Caen, for Paris. Soon after, he was sought after by the best company. He had left his devotion behind in Normandy, and the company of Fontenelle, Mairan, Mirabaud, D'Alembert, Diderot certainly inspired him to keep things this way. In 1759, his business recalled him in Normandy for a few months. Instead, he remained there for nearly eight years. Keen to lure him back to the capital, Diderot and his friends plotted a ruse inspired by the true story of a nun named Marguerite Delamarre who had appealed her vows: they pretended that nun had escaped the convent and was addressing the Marquis to seek his help. The ploy to bring the Marquis back to Paris failed when, instead of returning to Paris, the Marquis offered asylum to the imaginary nun in his home in Normandy. French literature gained one of its most poignant novels. Croismare finally returned to Paris in 1767, having lost none of his gaiety, playfulness and grace, which held true until company where his death. "

1966 ," The Siege of Massilia, including a naval battle, was an episode of Caesar's civil war, fought in 49 BC between forces loyal to the Optimates and a detachment of Caesar's army. The siege was conducted by Gaius Trebonius, one of Caesar's senior legates, while the naval operations were in the capable hands of Decimus Brutus, Caesar's naval expert. 
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus had become proconsul of Gaul and was sent to gain control of Massilia (modern Marseille) in order to oppose Caesar. As Caesar marched to Hispania (en route to the Battle of Ilerda), the Massiliots closed their gates to him, having allied with Ahenobarbus and the Optimates. Roused by their hostile actions, he commenced a siege against Massilia, leaving the newly raised 17th, 18th, and 19th legions to conduct the siege under the command of Gaius Trebonius. He also placed Decimus Brutus in charge of his fleet there. Caesar himself marched with his veteran legions to Hispania to fight the Pompeian generals Lucius Afranius and Marcus Petreius. He would return to the siege of Massilia after defeating his opponents at the battle of Ilerda.
After the siege had begun, Ahenobarbus arrived in Massilia to defend it against the Caesarian forces. In late June, Caesar's ships, although they were less skilfully built than those of the Massiliots and outnumbered, were victorious in the ensuing naval battle.
Gaius Trebonius conducted the siege using a variety of siege machines including siege towers, a siege-ramp, and a 'testudo-ram'. Gaius Scribonius Curio, careless in adequately guarding the Sicilian Straits, allowed Lucius Nasidius to bring more ships to the aid of Ahenobarbus. He fought a second naval battle with Decimus Brutus in early September, but withdrew defeated and sailed for Hispania.
Trebonius built a stationary tower, 30 feet (9.1 m) square and six stories in height, under the very walls of the city and in the face of a rain of missiles from its engines. The walls of the tower were of brickwork 5 feet (1.5 m) thick. When the lowest storey was built it was covered with a solid fireproof roof which was not secured to the walls but rested upon them like a lid. The eaves projected
considerably, and from them screens were hung on all sides, covering all the walls. By means of screws the whole canopy, roof, and screens was now raised to the height of one storey and the workmen proceeded to build the
walls of that storey under its protection. This process was repeated in the same
manner until the full height of the tower was attained.The Massiliots valiantly defended against the siege machines and works. They threw down burning pitch and pine-shavings and the Caesarians undermined the foundations of their city walls. At one point they seemed likely to surrender and declare a truce, but at night they cunningly destroyed the siege works in a gross violation of the treaty, according to Caesar's own account (Bellum Civile 2.14; alternatively, Dio 41.25.2 records that the Massiliots destroyed these works in response to a surprise attack by the Caesarian forces). The city's inhabitants were then near surrender.
At the final surrender of Massilia, Caesar showed his usual leniency and Lucius Ahenobarbus escaped to Thessaly in the only vessel that was able to escape from the Populares. Afterwards, Massilia was allowed to keep nominal autonomy, due to ancient ties of friendship and support of Rome, along with some territories while most of its empire was confiscated by Julius Caesar.

It is a list of the cheeses used up by the monastery in various activities, either as food or as payment. Its orthography is reflective of early Iberian Romance pronunciation and diverges sharply from classical Latin. It is of interest as being perhaps the first surviving text in the Leonese language, but more probably it represents an Iberian Romance predating any useful distinction between Leonese and Castilian. The conventional title of the list comes from its first three words (incipit) and means 'list of cheeses', similar to modern Spanish noticia / lista / relación de (los) quesos.

CDHRI declares its purpose to be 'general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights'.
This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees some, but not all, of the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the OIC to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the sharia. Because of this limit, the CDHRI has been criticized as an attempt to shield OIC member states from international criticism for human rights violations, as well as for failing to guarantee freedom of religion, justifying corporal punishment and allowing discrimination against non-Muslims and women.

2040 ," Apposition is a grammatical construction in which two elements, normally noun phrases, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the two elements are said to be in apposition. One of the elements is called the appositive, although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.
For example, in the two sentences below, the phrases Alice Smith and my sister are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:

My sister, Alice Smith, likes jelly beans.
Alice Smith, my sister, likes jelly beans.Traditionally, appositions were called by their Latin name appositio, although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: ad ('near') and positio ('placement').
Apposition is a figure of speech of the scheme type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as hyperbatons, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: 'My wife, a nurse by training, ...', it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification 'a nurse by training'. "

The name Micropædia is a neologism coined by Mortimer J. Adler from the ancient Greek words for 'small' and 'instruction'; the best English translation is perhaps 'brief lessons'.

This limit was relaxed in the major re-organization of the 15th edition; many articles were condensed together, resulting in roughly 65,000 articles in 12 volumes.

2068 ," C2T (an abbreviation for Cable Chaining Technology) is an IBM technology for KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) chaining.C2T, built into some of the IBM's xSeries and Netfinity models, allows daisy-chaining up to forty-two compatible servers in a single rack. Servers are daisy-chained using a special purpose cable which is included with new servers. The final server in the stack is connected to a monitor/keyboard/mouse or a KVM switch using a C2T breakout cable, which provides PS/2 and VGA connectors. The breakout cable was once very expensive to purchase new, but are now obtainable for less than $30 USD online.
C2T works thanks to a chip in each server that emulates a KVM switch. To take control of a certain xSeries server in the rack, user needs to press Num Lock twice, 'nn' (where 'nn' is the number of the server) and then press Enter, or could also manually press the button on the front of the desired xSeries server. The theory behind C2T is to reduce clutter and save money as no KVM switch is required. "

2138 ," The propaganda tactic of 'red-tagging' in the Philippines has often been directed towards individuals and organizations critical of the Philippine government, who are labeled 'communist' or 'terrorist' regardless of their actual beliefs or affiliations.Filipino journalists also sometimes call the practice 'red-baiting,' although in other countries, that term can also refer to a rhetorical technique, separately from the propaganda practice.
Although the Philippines is a constitutional democracy where beliefs and political expressions are supposed to be protected, red-tagging has had a long history in the country, and cause oriented groups including the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch warn that the use of red-tagging as a political tactic continues to undermine Philippine democracy by stifling dissent, encouraging authoritarian practices, and generally having a chilling effect on discourse and debate.The Philippine independent news organization Vera Files notes that because President Rodrigo Duterte declared the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army (CPP-NPA) a terrorist organization under the Human Security Act of 2007 (Republic Act 9372) in 2017, individuals and organizations who have been red-tagged are vulnerable to interception and recording of communication, detention without charges, restricted travel and personal liberties, examination of bank records, and the seizure and sequestaration of their assets. Reporters Without Borders notes that red-tagged individuals are vulnerable to death threats and violence.The New People's Army is waging an insurgency against the Government of the Philippines, with forces numbering up to 4,200 according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines in 2017. However, organizations frequently subject to 'red-tagging' in the Philippines include human rights organizations, church or religious groups, health worker unions, the academe, and the mainstream media.

In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi), and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over C$750 million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.Fox was a distance runner and basketball player for his Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, high school and Simon Fraser University. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played wheelchair basketball in Vancouver, winning three national championships.
In 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached Ontario; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.

2148 ," In enzymology, a monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) (EC 1.6.5.4) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NADH + H+ + 2 monodehydroascorbate 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   NAD+ + 2 ascorbateThe 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADH, H+, and monodehydroascorbate, whereas its two products are NAD+ and ascorbate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH, with a quinone or similar compound as an acceptor.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADH: monodehydroascorbate oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADH: semidehydroascorbic acid oxidoreductase, MDHA, semidehydroascorbate reductase, AFR, AFR-reductase, ascorbic free radical reductase, ascorbate free radical reductase, SOR, MDAsA reductase (NADPH), SDA reductase, NADH: ascorbate radical oxidoreductase, NADH-semidehydroascorbate oxidoreductase, ascorbate free-radical reductase, NADH: AFR oxidoreductase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH2).  This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
In plants, the monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) is an enzymatic component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle that is one of the major antioxidant systems of plant cells for the protection against the damages produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The MDAR activity has been described in several cell compartments, such as chloroplasts, cytosol, mitochondria, glyoxysomes, and leaf peroxisomes. "

2168 ," 'The Answer's at the End' is a song by English rock musician George Harrison, released in 1975 on his final album for Apple Records, Extra Texture (Read All About It). Part of the song lyrics came from a wall inscription at Harrison's nineteenth-century home, Friar Park, a legacy of the property's original owner, Sir Frank Crisp. This aphorism, beginning 'Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass', had resonated with Harrison since he bought Friar Park in 1970, and it was a quote he often used when discussing his difficult relationship with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney.
Harrison's adaptation of the verse for 'The Answer's at the End' coincided with a period of personal upheaval, following the severe criticism afforded his 1974 North American tour by several influential reviewers. In its plea for tolerance and a musical arrangement that includes orchestral strings, the song recalls Harrison's 1970 hit ballad 'Isn't It a Pity'. The arrangement also bears the influence of Nina Simone's 1972 cover version of 'Isn't It a Pity', specifically in a pair of codas performed by Harrison in the soul style.
Harrison recorded 'The Answer's at the End' in Los Angeles, where he was overseeing projects relating to his Dark Horse record label during much of 1975. The backing musicians on the recording include members of the Dark Horse Records band Attitudes, among them David Foster and Jim Keltner. As with much of Extra Texture, the song has received a varied response from music critics and Harrison's biographers. On release, Rolling Stone dismissed the track as 'padded subterfuge' and overlong, while Melody Maker described it as 'majestic' and one of Harrison's 'most potent tracks ever, highly emotional and introspective'.

She co-wrote and co-produced the song with Paul 'DJ White Shadow' Blair, Nick Monson, and Dino Zisis.

2203 ," Acappella Vocal Band (AVB) was a vocal group put together by Keith Lancaster in 1986 to augment the vocal group Acappella. AVB's popularity and ministry quickly grew, prompting Lancaster to launch AVB as a full-time touring group in 1988. AVB went through various lineup and stylistic changes before disbanding in 2000.
In addition to their early duties as Acappella's opening act and augmentation group, AVB performed and recorded as an independent ensemble. Many of their recordings, which included Give Me Light (1987) and Steppin' On A Cloud (1988), were later re-released on a CD titled The Early Years. In June 1988, with Acappella's expansion to a quartet, AVB branched off to tour on their own under the auspices of Acappella Ministries. Both groups underwent a shift in musical style during this period. Whereas previously, they had covered traditional hymns, praise songs and contemporary Christian pop music, both Acappella and AVB now recorded and performed primarily original music, much of which was composed by Lancaster. Acappella forged ahead with an adult contemporary sound while AVB targeted the youth market.
With Song In My Soul (1989), AVB made a major shift toward contemporary pop, rock and R&B sounds, though still entirely produced a cappella. On What's Your Tag Say?, the shift toward slick hip-hop and R&B was even greater, with a strong lyrical focus on the youth market and extensive choreography incorporated into their live performances. By the time Celebrate And Party became popular, the transformation to a near-perfect a cappella mimicry of the new jack swing style had been achieved, with a sound similar to Take 6, Boyz II Men, and Tony! Toni! Toné!. The song U & Me & God Make 5 followed in 1993, producing a hit on the CCM charts. The AVB lineup of John K. Green, Brishan Hatcher, Wes McKinzie, Max Plaster and Steve Reischl also recorded AVB's Spanish project, Caminando en la Luz (1994), and 'greatest hits' compilation, The Road (1995).

2222 ," Vorovoro is an island in the province of Macuata in the Vanua Levu Group of northern Fiji, 40 minutes away from the town of Labasa by boat.
Vorovoro island is inhabited by the Mali tribe, a traditional Fijian tribe which also has villages nearby on both Mali Island and Vanua Levu. Vorovoro is home to Tui Mali (the Chief of the Mali Tribe) and his family, as well as the Vorovoro Cultural Centre.Between 2006 and 2011 the island was run by Tribewanted, a self-described 'unique community tourism project'. During this time, the island and the project received extensive media coverage, including a five-part BBC documentary called Paradise or Bust.In 2012, the Mali community began a partnership with Bridge the Gap, a non-governmental organization that assists communities with sustainable community development. Bridge the Gap partners with Vorovoro in the planning and execution of Vorovoro's community development goals and to bolster Vororovo's global outreach opportunities while maintaining the integrity of the tribe's rich cultural heritage and working to protect the local natural environment.The partnership uses a multipronged approach for reaching these development goals. This approach includes business mentorship programs, sustainable agricultural training, infrastructure support, and networking with various international organizations.However, the most unique approach may be the formation of a Fijian-run eco-tourism business; facing pressures to develop Vorovoro island into a profitable tourism enterprise owned and managed by foreign investors, Vorovoro leadership had wanted a way to retain control of their traditional community home.  By opening their home to a limited number of (predominately student) visitors each year, Vorovoro has been able to take control of tourism on their land while creating a source of income for the Mali community.
In collaboration with Bridge the Gap, Vorovoro has formed a partnership with the Auburn University College of Human Sciences to develop and offer a unique, accredited study abroad program focused on cultural immersion, environmental awareness, and global sustainability. During the study abroad program, students live on Vorovoro while engaging with the local culture and studying various methods of community development. In order to build on the increasing momentum that the Auburn University partnership has had on Vorovoro's development, Bridge the Gap has begun to expand with Arizona State University and other major universities. Vorovoro plans to continue to expand their tourism business to other interested universities as well as through worldschooling family programs and dive trips.After Bridge the Gap intern (Sibley Barnette) studied abroad on Vorovoro with Auburn University, she brought her father, Dave Barnette, to the island in 2018 to gain the unique experience that Vorovoro has to offer. This visit resulted in Dave writing an article for the Washington Post, 'Too much seawater, not enough drinking water: Fiji's fight to withstand climate change.' The article has helped to shed light on Vorovoro and has served as a spark for future tourism development. "

2224 ," Bell Bajao (Hindi for 'ring the bell') is an anti-domestic violence campaign that urges local residents to take a stand against physical abuse through simple acts meant to interrupt domestic violence.  When residents, especially men, overhear violence against a woman taking place, they are urged to ring the doorbell and ask a simple question - such as to borrow some tea, to use the phone, or to have a glass of water. This is meant to let the abuser know that others can hear them and will act to interrupt the violence.
The campaign was launched in India on August 20, 2008 by Breakthrough in collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, UNIFEM and the UN Trust Fund. The global campaign, known in English as Ring The Bell, was launched at the Clinton Global Initiative.

The campaign featured award-winning Public Service Announcements, as well as media and training tools. The campaign targets boys and men and calls on them to intervene if they witness domestic violence. A key aspect of the campaign was thinking of men as partners in ending domestic violence, instead of only as violators. The PSAs reached over 130 million people. Like the 'Is This Justice?' campaign, this campaign was produced pro bono by the advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather and directed by Bauddhayan Mukherji of Little Lamb Films. "

It has sometimes been dated as early as the 8th or 9th century. Its authorship is unknown. The third-person narrative describes a vision of heaven and hell attributed to Adamnán (d. 704 AD), abbot of Hy and Iona and primary biographer of Saint Columba.The Vision of Adamnán appears in The Book of the Dun Cow and the Speckled Book, both held by the Royal Irish Academy, and two additional manuscripts. About 5,000 words long, it was influenced by the Apocalypse of the Seven Heavens, the Vision of Paul, and writings by Gregory the Great. It is the earliest Irish visionary work to use the literary device of a  bridge that souls must cross as part of a sorting ordeal, and marks the origin of visionary literature about the trials of the spiritual pilgrim in the Irish tradition. The Vision of Adamnán influenced the Hiberno-Latin Vision of Tundale, which was widely disseminated in various languages, and was a precursor to the Divine Comedy of Dante in describing a tripartite otherworld through which the pilgrim is escorted by a spiritual guide.

Incumbent Ion Iliescu led the field in the first round, but was forced into a runoff with Emil Constantinescu, candidate of the opposition Romanian Democratic Convention. Constantinescu ran on a quicker transition to a market economy and purging remaining Communist influence from the government. He benefited from a marked downturn in Iliescu's popularity tied to both high unemployment and concerns that Iliescu was wavering in his commitment to democracy.Despite this, opinion polls ahead of the runoff suggested that Iliescu was favoured for a second full term. Not only was it believed that his 16-point first-round lead was too large for Constantinescu to overcome, but most of the minor candidates were expected to throw their support to Iliescu. In the end, Iliescu was reelected with 61 percent of the vote.

Alevis are found primarily in Turkey among ethnic Turks and Kurds, and make up approximately 11% of the population, they are the second-largest sect of Islam in Turkey, with Sunni Hanafi Islam being the largest.After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a dispute arose about his legitimate successor. The Islamic community was divided into those who adhered to Abu Bakr, named Sunnis, and those who sided with Ali, called Shia. Concurrently, people who sided with Ali were called Alevis, defined as 'those who adore Ali and his family'. Therefore, some authors use Shiism synonymously with Alevism. However, Alevism is not Twelver Shiism, but rather its own Sufi centric form of Shiism, and although they share some common beliefs with the Twelver Shia, their rites and practises are different from Shiism. Thus Alevism incorporates Turkish and Kurdish folk and cultural beliefs present during the 14th century, mixed with Shia, Sunni and Sufi beliefs that were adopted by some Turkish and Kurdish tribes and later integrated into Sunni Islam.Alevis have strong links with Twelver Shia Islam (such as importance of the Ahl al-Bayt, the Aşura, the Mourning of Muharram, commemorating Karbala), but do not follow taqlid towards a Marja' 'source of emulation'. Some practices of the Alevis are based on Sufi elements of the Bektashi Tariqa. "

He sat on numerous company boards, including those of a mine and of a credit bank for encouraging industrial firms. The Balș family had extensive rural properties in Moldavia, but his parents gradually had to sell their lands in order to pay off debts and losses by their administrators. In 1880, his father sold the imposing residence in Iași that today houses the Music Conservatory.In 1897, Balș married Maria Știrbey, the daughter of prince Alexandru B. Știrbei and the sister of Barbu Știrbey. The marriage contract specifies that the bride received a trousseau of 25,000 lei, and that she wished to invest 200,000 lei of her parents' inheritance for building and furnishing a house.

2342 ," The 2007 Pittsburgh RiverRats season was the 1st season for the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) franchise.
The Explosion began play in 2007 as the Pittsburgh RiverRats, playing that season's home games at the Rostraver Ice Garden in Rostraver Township, Pennsylvania. The 'RiverRats' name and logo were originally supposed to be used by the Reading Express, but that team chose the Express branding instead, freeing it up for use by another American Indoor Football League (AIFL) team. In August 2006, more arguments came about the RiverRats name as a team in the Eastern Indoor Football League, called the 3 River Rats, had intentions of suing the RiverRats to retain the naming rights of the team.On August 20, 2006, the RiverRats signed quarterback David Dinkins, formerly of the Erie Freeze of the AIFA, and designated him as the team's franchise player for the 2007 season.The RiverRats played their first game on February 3, 2007 on the road in Tupelo, MS, but lost 54-34 to the Mississippi Mudcats. Their first home game was on February 18, 2007 which they lost 35-28 to the Reading Express. Pittsburgh won its first home game by beating the Danville Demolition 47-21 on March 4, 2007, and then won its first away game by beating Danville a second time, on March 9, 2007, by a score of 34-29. On May 19, 2007, the RiverRats set an AIFA single game record when they scored 86 points in a single game.The team finished their inaugural season at a respectable 7-7 record, good for fourth place in the Northern Conference and a wild-card playoff berth. However, the RiverRats were eliminated in the first round, losing 42-24 to the eventual conference champions Reading Express. "

2366 ," A beneficiary (also, in trust law, cestui que use) in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. For example, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person who receives the payment of the amount of insurance after the death of the insured. 
Most beneficiaries may be designed to designate where the assets will go when the owner(s) dies. However, if the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries are not alive or do not qualify under the restrictions, the assets will probably pass to the contingent beneficiaries. Other restrictions such as being married or more creative ones can be used by a benefactor to attempt to control the behavior of the beneficiaries. Some situations such as retirement accounts do not allow any restrictions beyond death of the primary beneficiaries, but trusts allow any restrictions that are not illegal or for an illegal purpose.
The concept of a 'beneficiary' will also frequently figure in contracts other than insurance policies. A third-party beneficiary of a contract is a person whom the parties intend to benefit from its provisions but who is not a party to the contract. A software distributor, for example, may seek provisions protecting its customers from infringement claims. A software licensor may include in its agreements provisions that protect those who provided code to that licensor.
In the context of development aid, the term 'beneficiaries' refer to the persons and the communities that use the project outputs: the entities that development-aid projects. "

From the Seaford Historical Society's website: 'Purchased by the Seaford Historical Society in 1976, this rare and complete Victorian Italianate mansion, ca. 1850s, has been lovingly restored and fully furnished. ... The Gov. Ross Mansion was built in the 1850s by William Henry Harrison Ross for himself and his family. Ross served as the Democratic Governor of Delaware from 1851 to 1855. Extremely popular with the people, he was instrumental in bringing the railroad into Southern Delaware. Trains running daily to Philadelphia vitalized the economy as farmers switched crops from wheat and corn to higher priced tomatoes, strawberries, peaches and other perishables. 

Ross became a local hero, but he was also a slave owner and Southern sympathizer. When war broke out between the states, Delaware sided with the North. Ross supported the Confederacy, and was forced to England. Today, the Gov. Ross Mansion stands as a reminder of pre-Civil War life.'

2378 ," A crystal detector is an obsolete electronic component used in some early 20th century radio receivers that consists of a piece of  crystalline mineral which rectifies the alternating current radio signal and was employed as a detector (demodulator) to extract the audio modulation to produce the sound in the earphones. It was the first type of semiconductor diode, and one of the first semiconductor electronic devices.   The most common type was the so-called cat whisker detector, which consisted of a piece of crystalline mineral, usually galena (lead sulfide), with a fine wire touching its surface.  The 'asymmetric conduction' of electric current across electrical contacts between a crystal and a metal was discovered in 1874 by Karl Ferdinand Braun.  Crystals were first used as radio wave detectors in 1894 by Jagadish Chandra Bose in his microwave experiments. Bose first patented a crystal detector in 1901.  The crystal detector was developed into a practical radio component  mainly by G. W. Pickard, who began research on detector materials in 1902 and found hundreds of substances that could be used in forming rectifying junctions.  The physical principles by which they worked were not understood at the time they were used, but subsequent research into these primitive point contact semiconductor junctions in the 1930s and 1940s led to the development of modern semiconductor electronics.The unamplified radio receivers that used crystal detectors were called crystal radios.  The crystal radio was the first type of radio receiver that was used by the general public, and became the most widely used type of radio until the 1920s.  It became obsolete with the development of vacuum tube receivers around 1920, but continued to be used until World War 2. "

Arthur C. Clarke reported in his memoir Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography that the magazine's editors were prevented from simply retitling it The Twentieth Century that year by a copyright thief who had registered the name in advance and demanded a ransom for the rights to use it. In October 1933, the magazine ran
a review of H. G. Wells' work by Gerald Heard. Its title was subsequently changed again to The Twentieth Century in 1951, and the magazine was published until 1972. The magazine notably asserted, shortly before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, that, 'The only court in which nations' issues can and will be tried is the court of God, which is war.' "

2406 ," The New Victory Band was an English Country Dance band during the late 1970s/early 1980s.
The original line-up consisted of the members of Muckram Wakes (Roger Watson, Helen Watson, John Adams and Suzie Adams),  Pete and Chris Coe, and Ian and Linda Wordsworth.
There were several bands during the '70s looking for a different approach to playing country dance tunes and dancing than was current in the English Folk Dance and Song Society dances. Going back to listen to traditional musicians like Bob Cann and Scan Tester was a good start. Remembering that these were social dances, not a precious art form, gave licence to all sorts of creative cavorting. Of these new bands, Old Swan Band, Flowers and Frolics, Umps and Dumps, Pump and Pluck seemed to concentrate more on Southern English styles and repertoire. The New Victory Band developed a more Northerly aspect, listening to recordings of George Tremain, Ned Pearson, Adam Gray, Willie Taylor & Will Atkinson.
The New Victory Band recorded just one album, One More Dance & Then, for Topic Records in 1978.  It was re-released on CD by Backshift Records in 2000 and included six extra tracks recorded live on a continental tour towards the end of the band's existence.
During the life of the band, drummer Ian Wordsworth was replaced by Pierce Butler and additional members included Mel Dean on concertina and Peadar Long on sax.
The original instrumental line up was:

Pete Coe - Melodeon
Chris Coe - Hammered Dulcimer
John Adams [1] - Trombone, fiddle, melodeon, harmonium, banjo
Suzie Adams - banjo
Roger Watson - tuba, banjo, mouth organ
Helen Watson - harmonium, piano, whistle
Ian Wordsworth - drums
Linda Wordsworth - tap dancing "
2407 ," Raimondo, Count of Montecuccoli (Italian pronunciation: [raiˈmondo monteˈkukkoli]; German: Raimondo Graf Montecuccoli; 21 February 1609 – 16 October 1680) was an Italian-born professional soldier who served the Habsburg Monarchy. He was also a  Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Melfi, in the Kingdom of Naples.
Montecuccoli was considered as the only commander to be the equal of the French general Turenne, (1611–1675), and like him, was closely associated with the post-1648 development of linear infantry tactics. "

2409 ," In geography and geology, a cliff is a vertical, or nearly vertical, rock exposure. Cliffs are formed as erosion landforms by the processes of weathering and erosion. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs.
An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff, formed by the movement of a geologic fault or landslide, or by differential erosion of rock layers of differing hardness. 
Most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base.  In arid areas or under high cliffs, they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters. Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with mushroom rocks or other types of rock columns remaining. Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline.
The Ordnance Survey distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the top edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge). "
2410 ," The main campus is in North Philadelphia, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Center City. It occupies 118 acres (48 ha); an estimated 12,626 students live on or near it. Events for students and the public include concerts, performances, clubs, exhibits and lectures.
The campus has notable landmarks which have accrued over its history. O'Connor Plaza surrounds the Founder's Garden between Polett Walk and Liacouras Walk. The bronze statue of an owl, the university's mascot, is a popular photo spot at the heart of main campus.The Founder's Garden near Liacouras Walk, is the burial place of Russell Conwell, founder and 38-year president of Temple. A former Yale student, Civil War captain, Boston lawyer, and Philadelphia minister, Conwell used the income from his famous “Acres of Diamonds” speech to fund Temple as a place where working-class Philadelphians might receive higher education. It has been estimated that Conwell, who died at 82, helped more than 90,000 men and women pursue higher education. A bust of Conwell marks his grave. Another green area on campus is the Johnny Ring Garden. It is located near the faculty staff dining 'Diamond Club', and celebrates Conwell and Johnny Ring.
The Bell Tower sits at 110 feet (34 m) tall in the center of the Main Campus between what was the Samuel Paley Library and Beury Hall. The surrounding plaza and grassy area, the largest 'green space' on the urban campus, are commonly called 'the beach'.

2413 ," Charles Kaye Friedberg (1905–1972) was an American cardiologist, known for his medical textbook Diseases of the Heart, which was a standard reference in cardiology during the 1950s and 1960s.Friedberg received in 1925 his bachelor's degree from Columbia University and in 1929 his medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons).

He interned at Mount Sinai and took postgraduate work as an Emanuel Libman Fellow in Amsterdam and Vienna. A diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine, Dr. Friedberg served on the Council of the National Heart and Lung Institute, and was a Master of the American College of Physicians, a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and a member of the Academy of Medicine.
An acknowledged expert in the recognition and management of subacute bacterial endocarditis, and coauthor with Emanuel Libman of the classic monograph on the topic in 1941, his diagnostic dictum has helped guide several generations of physicians: “The diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis should be assumed as most probable whenever a patient with an organic cardiac murmur experiences fever, without apparent cause, for more than one week”  (Friedberg, 1949, p. 793).
In the mid-1930s, with Dr. Louis Gross, Friedberg investigated the cardiac pathoanatomy of rheumatic fever. Friedberg was a consulting cardiologist, and from 1956 to 1969 chief cardiologist, at Mount Sinai Hospital, and was a clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical School. He was the author, among other books, of Diseases of the Heart, published in Philadelphia by the W. B. Saunders Company in 1949, with a 2nd edition in 1959 and a 3rd edition in 1966. In 1958 he was the founding editor of the journal Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases. He was appointed editor-in-chief of the American Heart Association's journal Circulation, for a six-year term that started in January 1971, as successor to Howard B. Burchell (1908–2009).
In 1933 Dr. Friedberg married Gertrude Tonkonogy, who was the author of the Broadway play Three Cornered Hat. Upon his death in an automobile accident in 1972 he was survived by his widow, a son Richard, a daughter Barbara, and two grandchildren.According to the cardiologist Eugene Braunwald, Charles K. Friedburg was one of a small group of outstanding pioneers of cardiology as practiced in the era of medicine from the 1940s to the early 1970s; according to Braunwald the other pioneers included Charles Laubry, Samuel A. Levine, Thomas Lewis, James Mackenzie, John Parkinson, Paul Dudley White, and Paul Hamilton Wood.
As it turned out, Friedberg was the last American to write a single-authored textbook of cardiology. The reason: knowledge in cardiology and virtually every other major field of medicine was expanding too quickly for any one individual to master or write about quickly enough. The new model for textbooks would be one in which editors sought numerous experts to write chapters on specific topics, and tried to impose a consistent style and philosophy on the submitted materials. "
2414 ," CCITT Group 4 compression, also referred to as G4 or Modified Modified READ (MMR), is a lossless method of image compression used in Group 4 fax machines defined in the ITU-T T.6 fax standard.  It is only used for bitonal (black-and-white) images. Group 4 compression is based on the Group 3 two-dimensional compression scheme (G3-2D), also known as Modified READ, which is in turn based on the Group 3 one-dimensional compression scheme (G3), also known as Modified Huffman coding. Group 4 compression is available in many proprietary image file formats as well as standardized formats such as TIFF, CALS, CIT (Intergraph Raster Type 24) and the PDF document format.
G4 offers a small improvement over G3-2D by removing the end-of-line (EOL) codes. G3 and G4 compression both treat an image as a series of horizontal black strips on a white page. Better compression is achieved when there are fewer unique black dots/lines on the page. Both G3-2D and G4 add a two-dimensional feature to achieve greater compression by taking advantage of vertical symmetry. A worst-case image would be an alternating pattern of single-pixel black and white dots offset by one pixel on even/odd lines. G4 compression would actually increase the file size on this type of image. G4 typically achieves a 20:1 compression ratio. For an 8.5'×11' page scanned at 200 DPI, this equates to a reduction from 467.5 kB to 23.4 kB (95% compression ratio). "

2416 ," Dryness is a property of  beverages that describes the lack of a sweet taste.  This may be due to a lack of sugars, the presence of some other taste that masks sweetness, or an underabundance of simple carbohydrates that can be converted to sugar by enzymes in the mouth (amylase in particular). The term 'dry' may be applied to types of beer, wine, distilled spirits, or any other form of alcoholic beverage.In a dry martini, 'dry' originally referred to the inclusion of dry gin, however it is often incorrectly used to refer to the amount of vermouth used in the drink. A 'perfect' martini – or any other cocktail that uses vermouth, such as a Perfect Manhattan – is a martini made with equal parts dry and sweet vermouth. "
2417 ," The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Swedish industrialist, inventor, and armaments manufacturer Alfred Nobel, along with the prizes in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature. Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have 'done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses'.Per Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 1990, the prize is awarded on 10 December in Oslo City Hall each year. The prize was formerly awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law (1947–1989), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946), and the Parliament (1901–1904).
Due to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies.

2420 ," The Women's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2012 Summer Olympics took place on 4–6 August at the Olympic Stadium.From the gun in the final, reigning world champion Yuliya Zaripova sprinted out to the lead and dictated the pace.  But rather than continuing to accelerate, she slowed, with the rest of the field bunching behind with nobody willing to go around.  The pack slowly disintegrated by attrition.  With 3 laps to go a group of seven had separated, including all three Ethiopians, plus Milcah Chemos Cheywa, Mercy Wanjiku Njoroge and Habiba Ghribi, all still behind Zaripova. On the 6th lap, defending champion and World Record holder Gulnara Galkina, already off the back, made a right turn and stepped off the track.  The pace quickened, losing Etenesh Diro and Njoroge at the water jump.  Zaripova just continued to accelerate.  On the back stretch Ghribi looked to be clear of the other three but almost put her hand out so as not to pass Zaripova.  From that point, Zaripova just extended her lead with Ghribi clearly in second place.  Sofia Assefa broke away from her teammate Hiwot Ayalew.  Down the home stretch Cheywa made a late run but Assefa held on for the bronze medal. Compared to the previous year's world championships, the first two medalists were the same, Zaripova a second faster for her personal record, Ghribi was 3 seconds faster for her Tunisian national record, and Assefa 19 seconds faster to push Cheywa off the podium.On 24 March 2016 the Court of Arbitration for Sport disqualified Yuliya Zaripova's results from 20 July 2011 to 25 July 2013 for doping, which included the Olympics. On 4 June 2016, Tunisian Habiba Ghribi was awarded with the olympic gold medal in a ceremony in Rades, Tunisia, presented by IOC Vice-President Nawal El Moutawakel. "

2431 ," A package boiler is a factory-made boiler.  Package boilers are available in a range of standard designs. Package boilers are used for heating and act as a steam generator for small power purposes such as self-powered industrial plants. They cannot be used for large-scale power plants such as co-generation plants due to their size and lack of efficiency. Advantages of package boilers are that they can be brought in as a whole assembly, perfect for tight spaces, and easily installed. They require steam pipes, water pipes, fuel supply, electrical connections and can be made ready almost immediately. Because of their compact design, these boilers are cheaper to operate due to their automatic burner management system as well as maintenance cost.A great cost-saving for package boilers is their simple need for draughting. The chimney may either use an existing masonry chimney, or else a simple steel tube stack is provided, just sufficient to clear the nuisance of the exhaust fumes. As the burner provides its own draught from a fan, they do not require the tall brick chimneys needed to provide the draught for a coal-fired. "

2454 ," Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor  (Chinese: 林鄭月娥; Cantonese Yale: Làhm Jehng Yuht-ngòh; née Cheng, born 13 May 1957) is a Hong Kong politician serving as the fourth and current Chief Executive of Hong Kong since 2017. She served as the Secretary for Development from 2007 to 2012 and Chief Secretary for Administration from 2012 to 2017.
After graduating from the University of Hong Kong Lam joined the British Hong Kong civil service in 1980 and served in various government agencies. She became a key official in 2007 when she was appointed Secretary for Development. During her tenure, she earned the nickname 'tough fighter' for her role in the controversial demolition of the Queen's Pier in 2008.
Lam became Chief Secretary for Administration under the Leung Chun-ying administration in 2012. From 2013 to 2015 Lam headed the Task Force on Constitutional Development for the 2014 Hong Kong electoral reform and held talks with student and opposition leaders during the widespread protests. In the 2017 Chief Executive selection process, Lam obtained 777 votes from the 1,194-member appointed Election Committee as the Beijing-favoured candidate and became the first female Chief Executive of Hong Kong.
Lam's administration has seen controversies, including the trial and imprisonment of democracy activists, the disqualification of several pro-democracy candidates, as well as the criminalisation of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party. Her government was also criticised for raising the qualification age for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and for its handling of the cross-harbour tunnel toll plan, among other policies.
In mid-2019, Lam's government pushed for a controversial amendment to the extradition law which received widespread domestic and international opposition. Massive protests broke out and persisted throughout the latter half of the year, from demanding the withdrawal of the bill to Lam's resignation among five key demands. Lam suspended the bill in June and did not withdraw the bill until September. She also stood firmly against the other demands including an independent inquiry into police conduct and universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections. The clashes between the protesters and police escalated, which resulted in more than 9,000 arrests as of July 2020. Lam's popularity also dropped to a historic low with the pro-Beijing camp suffering the worst landslide defeat in history in the November District Council election. "

The National People's Congress meets in full session for roughly two weeks each year and votes on important pieces of legislation. Members are considered to be part-time legislators and are not paid.

Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16·4(H2O), whose name is derived from its resemblance with talc and its high water content. The layers of the structure stack in multiple ways, to produce a 3-layer rhombohedral structure (3R Polytype), or a 2-layer hexagonal structure (2H polytype) formerly known as manasseite. The two polytypes are often intergrown. The carbonate anions that lie between the structural layers are weakly bound, so hydrotalcite has anion exchange capabilities.

2597 ," Twin films are films with the same, or very similar, plot produced or released at the same time by two different film studios. The phenomenon can result from two or more production companies investing in similar scripts around the same time, resulting in a race to distribute the films to audiences. Some attribute twin films to industrial espionage, the movement of staff between studios, or that the same screenplays are sent to several film studios before being accepted. Another possible explanation is if the films deal with topical issues, such as volcanic eruptions, reality television, terrorist attacks or significant anniversaries, resulting in multiple discovery of the concept.Screenwriter Terry Rossio notes that there are always film projects with similar subjects being developed in multiple studios while usually only one of them makes it into production in a given period of time, and therefore twin films are better regarded as exceptions to this tendency. In one case, for the 1974 film The Towering Inferno, the fear of having competing action thrillers, both set in a burning skyscraper, convinced two Hollywood studios to merge their productions into one (all-star) film.While twin films usually are big budget films, a mockbuster can be made with a low budget, with similar titles, aesthetics or theme as blockbuster films. Mockbusters are usually given more limited release and marketing, intending to take advantage of the public interest in the topic driven by the major film.

2598 ," Kurloff cells (also known as Foà-Kurloff cells,) were described as mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood and organs of the guinea pig, capybara, paca, agouti and cavie.  The Kurloff cell contains a characteristic proteoglycan-containing inclusion body. In the guinea pig, Kurloff cells are more numerous in the adult female than the adult male. A marked increase in the number of circulating Kurloff cells is present in the peripheral blood during pregnancy and after estrogen treatment in male and female animals. A relatively smaller number of cells take place in immature, non-pregnant, and non-estrogen-treated animals. The exact function of Kurloff cells remains unknown, but it has some of the characteristics of both monocytes and lymphocytes. In guinea-pigs, it has been proposed that Kurloff cells mainly involve in the function of the immune system, such as acting as a natural killer cell and preventing damage to the trophoblast by maternal defensive cells. Also, Kurloff cells present antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity in vitro. "

2612 ," Indian Echo Caverns is a show cave in Derry Township (Dauphin County) near Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, USA. The limestone caves are open for the public to visit via guided tour.
The entrance to the caverns used by modern visitors is located in a bluff along the Swatara Creek. A second entrance was sealed for security purposes when the caverns were commercialized in the late 1920s. The known portions of the caverns, most of which have been commercialized, represent the intersection of two passages: the 'eastern' cavern and the 'northern' cavern, which meet at right angles to form a large space known as the 'Indian Ballroom.'
Given the large and accessible natural openings the caverns were likely utilized by Native Americans for storage and shelter, however no evidence of such use has survived. The location was previously known as Wilson Cave, Hummelstown Cave, Stoverdale Cave, Giant's Cave, and Indian Cave. When it was commercialized it was renamed Indian Echo Cave. It has more recently been known as Indian Echo Caverns.  
For nineteen years (1802–1821) the caverns were the home of William Wilson, known as the Pennsylvania Hermit. Wilson withdrew from society after his failure to halt the execution of his sister Elizabeth for the murder of her twin sons. Following her death in Chester, Pennsylvania in 1786, William wandered westward across southeastern Pennsylvania, settling in the caverns in 1802. The Sweets of Solitude: Instructions to Mankind How They May Be Happy in a Miserable World, an essay supposedly written by Wilson during his time in the caverns, was published following his death.
The same geological system of which the caverns are a part is responsible for many sinkholes in an area stretching from Hummelstown to as far as Palmyra, and as far south as Middletown. "

2628 ," The Bay of Quinte Railway is a former short line railway in eastern Ontario, Canada. It was formed as the Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway (NT&QR), chartered in 1878 by Edward Rathbun and Alexander Campbell, with plans to run from Napanee through Renfrew County and on to the Ottawa Valley. Lacking funding from the governments, development never began.
Rathburn took over the charter in 1881. He started construction with the shorter Bay of Quinte Railway and Navigation Company (BQR&NC) that ran from his factories in Deseronto to the Grand Trunk Railway mainline at Napanee. Construction on the NT&QR out of Napanee through Yarkers to Tamworth started the same year, but was abandoned by the contractor and Rathburn had to pay the workers out of pocket.
The line finally opened to Tamworth in 1884. In 1889 it was extended westward to Tweed while a branch eastward from Yarker to Harrowsmith connected to the Kingston and Pembroke Railway with running rights to Kingston. In 1890 the line was renamed the Kingston, Napanee & Western Railway, and the next year it was leased to the BQR&NC. The eastern branch was extended from Harrowsmith to Sydenham in 1893. In 1897, the two sections were legally merged into the newly formed Bay of Quinte Railway. In 1903 the final expansion was made northwestward from Tweed to connect to the Central Ontario Railway at Bannockburn, with a total of 134 kilometres (83 mi).
The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in 1910, using its line from Napanee through Sydenham as the basis of a major expansion to Smiths Falls and onto Ottawa. CNoR's bankruptcy in 1918, followed by the Grand Trunk in 1923 led to the formation of the Canadian National Railways (CNR). Parts of the network were closed starting in 1935, and the last BQR fragment, from Napanee's historic 1856 Grand Trunk station to a Goodyear tire factory, was disconnected from the CN mainline at Napanee station in 2010.

2632 ," In baseball, ground rules are special rules particular to each baseball park (grounds) in which the game is played. Unlike the well-defined playing field of most other sports, the playing area of a baseball field extends to an outfield fence in fair territory and the stadium seating in foul territory. The unique design of each ballpark, including fences, dugouts, bullpens, railings, stadium domes, photographer's wells and TV camera booths, requires that rules be defined to handle situations in which these objects may interact or interfere with the ball in play or with the players.
Major League Baseball has defined a set of 'universal ground rules' that apply to all MLB ballparks; individual ballparks have the latitude to set ground rules above and beyond the universal ground rules, as long as they do not directly contradict each other. Additionally, a set of universal ground rules exists for the six MLB stadiums with retractable roofs, with the individual ballparks able to set additional rules.
The term ground rule double is often applied to a batted ball that bounces fair, then over the outfield fence in fair or foul territory, although some commentators and writers shun the term because league-wide rules, not ground rules, apply in this case. "

The name is first found on the northernmost runestone in Europe, the Frösö Runestone, as eotalont (in normalized Old Norse: Jamtaland). The prefix Jamta is a genitive plural case of Jamts, a Germanic tribe.

2712 ," The geostationary ring is a volume segment around the geostationary orbit defined by variations in altitude and declination that can occur for uncontrolled objects left in the geostationary orbit.
The geostationary orbit is subject to orbit perturbations caused by anomalies in the gravitational field of the Earth, by the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon, and by solar radiation pressure.
A precessional motion of the orbit plane is caused by the oblatedness of the Earth (

    {\displaystyle J_{2}}
  ), and the gravitational effects of Sun and Moon. This motion has a period of about 53 years. The two parameters describing the direction of the orbit plane in space, the right ascension of the ascending node, and the inclination are affected by this precession. The maximum inclination reached during the 53-year cycle is about 15 degrees. Therefore, the definition of the geostationary ring foresees a declination range from -15 degrees to +15 degrees.
On the other hand, solar radiation pressure induces an eccentricity that leads to a variation of the orbit radius by ± 75 kilometers in some cases.
This leads to the definition of the geostationary ring as being a segment of space around the geostationary orbit that ranges from 75 km below GEO to 75 km above GEO and from -15 degrees to 15 degrees declination. "

After three-and-a-half seasons with the Red Sox, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers in 1959 and served the team through the 1960 season. Before the 1961 season, he was selected by the Washington Senators in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft, for whom he played the 1961 season. He was then traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 1962, playing one season at the major league level, and one in their minor league system.
His most productive years came with Boston, where he won 24 games from 1956 to 1958, averaging 138 innings each season. After that, he appeared strictly as a reliever and saved a career-high 11 games for the Senators. In a seven-season career, Sisler posted a 38–44  record with a 4.33 ERA in 247 appearances, including 29 saves, 12 complete games, one shutout and 656⅓ innings.

2718 ," Sam Steinberg (1896–1982) was an American outsider art painter from The Bronx, New York, called the 'unofficial artist-in-residence' at Columbia University by Peter Frank (art critic). His work was 'shown' (and sold) exclusively on the Columbia campus, and his style was one of the first identified as 'outsider,' an approach coined by art critic Roger Cardinal c. 1972, after Jean Dubuffet's art brut.Suffering from a debilitating hairlessness disease, atrichia with papular lesions, Steinberg was classified 4F in both world wars. In the late 1930s, he and his mother started visiting Columbia daily to sell chocolate bars. 
Signed with his distinctive cursive signature, 'Sam S.,' Steinberg spontaneously began showing and selling original paintings in 1967. He purchased illustration boards and paints from local stationery stores; eventually shifting to permanent magic marker pens. His subjects ranged from animals to popular culture figures like Santa Claus and Elvis Presley, but Steinberg's favorite muses were most certainly his interpretations of cats and 'boids.' After riding three New York City Subway trains to arrive at Columbia, he was usually carrying three or four fresh paintings (often as many as 20 per week), which, during the 1970s sold for $2.50 (rising to $3.50 by 1980). A campus art institution, it was a rare Columbia College dormitory room that didn't have at least one 'Sam' hanging up. His one known example of a commercial use of his paintings was in 1973, for a jazz fusion album recorded by a former Columbia student, Marc Copland (known in his student days as 'Marc Cohen') on a label, Oblivion Records co-founded by another, Fred Seibert.  He is known to have painted at least one large oil, 'Judy in the sky with kitties.'  Judy Garland and Kitties were favorite themes.  He also produced a series of 'miniatures', priced cheaper than his larger paintings.  A hallmark of a Steinberg painting was the 'almond' shaped eyes of the subjects, placed on a 45% angle on each face.
Through his last decades, Steinberg shared an apartment and his art with his younger sister, colorist Pauline Steinberg.
In its Summer 1996 edition, Folk Art Magazine carried a feature-length article entitled “Sam Steinberg, House of Cardboard or Marble Palace,” presenting the first in-depth treatment of the artist, this appearing fourteen years after Steinberg’s death.The Fall 2014 issue of Columbia College Today, the alumni magazine of Columbia College, announced the first major retrospective covering Steinberg’s work since the late 1970s.   The Exhibition, sponsored by the Columbia College Class of 1975, is currently in its planning phase but is expected to premiere in late May 2015 on the Columbia University campus before moving to other venues across the country.

2760 ," Laughter is a physical reaction in humans consisting usually of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system resulting most commonly in forms of 'hee-hee' or 'ha-ha'. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling.
Laughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others. Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback.The study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology.

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and palmitate. It has a strict specificity for thioesters with a chain link greater than C10.
These enzymes are localized in almost all cellular compartments, such as endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. They are highly regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, which led to their involvement in lipid metabolism. The enzyme is up-regulated during times of increased fatty acid oxidation, which suggests that this enzyme has a potential role the peroxisomal beta-oxidation.
The systematic name of this enzyme class is palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA hydrolase, palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase, palmitoyl thioesterase, palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase, palmitoyl-CoA deacylase, palmityl thioesterase, palmityl-CoA deacylase, fatty acyl thioesterase I, and palmityl thioesterase I.

This Process Industry Cluster has been created by the chemistry using industries based in North East England where more than 1,400 companies are based in the supply chain of the sector. The sector has over 35,000 direct employees and some 190,000 indirect employees in the northeast of England and together they represent over one third of the industrial economy of the region. Companies in the Cluster manufacture 50% of the UK's Petrochemicals and 35% of the UK's Pharmaceuticals and they significantly contribute towards making the region the only net exporting region of the UK. The region has over £13 billion of exports.NEPIC was created in 2004 by the leaders of local chemistry based process industry companies that are based in the northeast of England. The aim of the organisation being to represent and coordinate industry's collaborative activities on the wide ranging issues that impact on the future and performance of the energy intensive process sector, which includes petrochemicals; specialty chemicals; polymers; pharmaceuticals; biotechnology and renewables. These issues include renewable and more sustainable energy opportunities, innovation and R&D interests, energy pricing capacity and availability, carbon taxation and carbon emission reduction technologies  such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), graduate and technician skills for the sector  and industry growth to ensure that the region remains a globally important location for the chemical industry.NEPIC has been recognised by the Chemical Industries Association (CIA) in the UK for its work in informing stakeholders about the sector and by the professional institutions in the UK for its engagement and representation of industry issues. The Northeast of England is recognised and promoted by the Department for International Trade (DIT)( formerly UK Trade and Investment (UKTI)) arm of the UK Government as a leading location in the UK for Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) into the chemistry using industries.Since its formation NEPIC has participated in European Cluster development programmes. During 2012 NEPIC was initially audited by the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis (ESCA) and in March 2014 achieved the Gold Label standard for Cluster management under this quality management scheme. NEPIC is classified by ESCA as a manufacturing and innovation cluster and was the first UK cluster to achieve this Gold Label status and the 37th Cluster to do so in Europe. By March 2014 there were 490 EU Cluster organisations accredited by ESCA. By September 2014 the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis reported that more than 600 Clusters had been audited and in their report, entitled 'Cluster Organisations in Europe – insights from Bronze and Gold Label Assessments', cited the NEPIC Members Directory as best practice as a Cluster global marketing tool. On 20 October 2014 at the European Commission's Bi-annual European Cluster Conference, policy makers, analysts and Cluster managers, from all business and industry sectors across Europe, named Dr Stan Higgins, NEPIC CEO, as European Cluster Manager of the Year 2014. NEPIC was reassessed by ESCA during 2016 and is validated as a Gold Label Cluster until February 2019 when the Cluster's management organisation has to undergo its next quality assessment. By March 2017 986 Clusters had been awarded Bronze, Silver and Gold Labels from 40 countries. 81 of which are Gold Label.NEPIC is led by industry through its Industry Leadership Team. These industry leaders at intervals of their choosing elect a person to be the Chair of NEPIC. Since its inception the cluster has been Chaired by Ian Shott CBE, Robert Coxon OBE, Paul Booth MBE and most recently former MP Ian Swales who is the current chair person. Dr Stan Higgins has been NEPIC's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) since its formation in 2004. Dr Higgins announced that he is to retire during 2017. On 1 June 2017 NEPIC announced that former Chair of the UK Parliamentary Business Committee and labour MP Iain Wright is to become the CEO of NEPIC. "

2785 ," The criticism of hadith refers to the critique directed towards collections of hadith. Hadith are collections of reports of the sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad — i.e. his words, actions, and the silent approval of on any matter. In other words, something that is attributed to Muhammad but is not found in the Quran. Criticism of hadith takes several forms.
Within traditional Islamic hadith studies the focus is on evaluating the authenticity of particular hadith reports and whether they are attributable to Muhammad. Key elements that are examined are whether there are 'other identical reports from other transmitters';  the reliability of the transmitters of the report; and 'the continuity of the chain of transmission'.Another question is the extent to which hadith should be relied upon as a source for Islamic law. Muslim critics of hadith and classical hadith studies include Islamic revivalists who strongly believe hadith are part of Islam but wish to reexamine hadith by their matn (content) in preparation for revising sharia law to make it more practical so that it may be enforced in Muslim society; those who believe only the small number of mutawatir hadith are reliable enough to be followed; and “deniers” of hadith who contend that Muslims should follow the Quran alone as Muslims still can not be certain of the authenticity of even the most highly rated (sahih or 'sound') hadith notwithstanding the great efforts by scholars of the science of hadith studies to validate hadith. 'Deniers' question whether the hadith can provide rulings on legal and religious matters when the Quran has already declared itself 'complete', 'clear', 'fully detailed' and 'perfected'.
In addition to questions from within the Islamic community, scholars from the West such as Ignác Goldziher and Joseph Schacht have offered criticisms of the hadith since the 19th century. "

2846 ," Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz). At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm, and at 30 Hz is 10,000 km. The wavelength of a radio wave can be anywhere from shorter than a grain of rice to longer than the radius of the Earth. Like all other electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum.  They are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration, such as time varying electric currents.  Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects. 
Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas.   Radio waves are very widely used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and radio navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.
To prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as 'electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3 000 GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide'. The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.

2849 ," In the United States, the lower class are those at or near the lower end of the socio-economic hierarchy. As with all social classes in the United States, the lower class is loosely defined and its boundaries and definitions subject to debate and ambiguous popular opinions. Sociologists such as W. Lloyd Warner, Dennis Gilbert and James Henslin divide the lower classes into two. The contemporary division used by Gilbert divides the lower class into the working poor and underclass. Service and low-rung manual laborers are commonly identified as being among the working poor. Those who do not participate in the labor force and rely on public assistance as their main source of income are commonly identified as members of the underclass. Overall the term describes those in easily filled employment positions with little prestige or economic compensation who often lack a high school education and are to some extent disenfranchised from mainstream society.Estimates for how many households are members of this class vary with definition. According to Dennis Gilbert roughly one quarter, 25%, of US households were in the lower classes; 13% were members among the working poor while 12% were members of the underclass. While many in the lower working class are employed in low-skill service jobs, lack of participation in the labor force remains the main cause for the economic plight experienced by those in the lower classes. In 2005, the majority of households (56%) in the bottom income quintile had no income earners while 65% of householders did not work. This contrasts starkly to households in the top quintile, 76% of whom had two or more income earners.Lacking educational attainment as well as disabilities are among the main causes for the infrequent employment. Many households rise above or fall below the poverty threshold, depending on the employment status of household members. While only about 12% of households fall below the poverty threshold at one point in time, the percentage of those who fall below the poverty line at any one point throughout a year is much higher. Working class as well as working poor households may fall below the poverty line if an income earner becomes unemployed. In any given year roughly one out of every five (20%) households falls below the poverty line at some point while up to 40% may fall into poverty within the course of a decade. "

2883 ," Mining sludge is the waste product of alluvial mining, and in particular hydraulic sluicing. It has been particularly prominent in gold fields in Australia and California in the nineteenth century.In the 1840s in California and 1850s in Australia, methods for extracting alluvial gold were developed which involved washing soil and gravel through sluice boxes using diverted streams and other water sources. The waste or tailings were released into the waterways forming large deposits of highly mobile sediment. This 'sludge' as it was generally termed, blocked the stream channels causing flooding and burial of land downstream.The cyanide process also involved releasing sediment contaminated with cyanide, while other sludge deposits have a variety of contaminants used in the mining process.
Large areas of land were affected by sludge, particularly in Victoria, where a Royal Commission was established in 1858-9 to investigate and manage the problem. This resulted in a number of regulations and the construction of large stone-lined sludge channels to concentrate and divert the sludge away from settled areas and buildings. the towns of Bendigo, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Creswick and Maryborough have channelized streams running through them as a result.Ultimately hydraulic sluicing was banned in 1904 as a result of the continuing environmental damage caused to waterways in places such as Omeo, and a Sludge Abatement Board was established to regulate and repair the problem..

It is a rectilinear plateau that covers an area of 90,000 square kilometres. Its width is about 400 kilometres (250 mi) east-west and 250 km (160 mi) north-south. The water depths are from 1500 to 5000 metres.The Mentelle Basin and Naturaliste Trough lie between the mainland and this plateau.  The plateau is bordered by the Perth Abyssal Plain in the north and west and the Australian-Antarctic Basin in the south.It is located within the Australian marine park known as the South-west Corner Marine Park.
The Naturaliste Plateau formed during the Early Cretaceous 136 Ma when Australia and India broke up and during the Late Cretaceous 83 Ma when Australia and Antarctica broke up. Lavas and intrusive rocks on the plateau flanks have ages of between 132-128 Ma. The eastern flank of the plateau slopes relatively gently, while the other three flanks are relatively steep.  The southern flank formed during the Australia-Antarctica break-up, the other flanks during the rifting between India and Australia.  The continent ocean transition (COT) is 30–90 km (19–56 mi) wide on the north side and 250 km (160 mi) on the southern side where the plateau is flanked by the Diamantina Fracture Zone.Before India broke off from Australia-Antarctica at 127 Ma the Naturaliste Plateau was flanked by what would become two microcontinents, the Batavia and Gulden Draak Knolls, now located on the western margin of the Perth Abyssal Plain 1,600 km (990 mi) from Australia.  South of the plateau, during some 45 Ma after India and the two knolls broke off, rifting occurred between the plateau and the Bruce Rise, now located off Antarctica.  This rifting continued until sea-floor spreading began 83 Ma.Continental metamorphic and granitic basement rocks have been dredged from both knolls.  Protolith granite from Gulden Draak was emplaced in either the Australian Yilgarn Craton or the Antarctic Mawson Craton 2850 Ma.  The Mesoproterozoic crust from this knoll is coeval with crust from the Naturaliste Plateau.  Neoproterozoic-Cambrian (540–530 Ma) granite gneisses from the Batavia Knoll were emplaced during or after the formation of the Kuunga Orogen. "

It is one of the most popular races on the Formula One calendar, due to the scenic and historical Spa-Francorchamps circuit being a favourite of drivers and fans. "
2923 ," 6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low -Power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the Internet area of the IETF.The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that 'the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,' and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things.The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are the work horses for data delivery for local-area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide-area networks such as the Internet. Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing communication-ability in the wireless domain. The inherent natures of the two networks though, are different.
The base specification developed by the 6LoWPAN IETF group is RFC 4944 (updated by RFC 6282 with header compression, and by RFC 6775 with neighbor discovery optimizations). The problem statement document is RFC 4919. IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is defined in RFC 7668.

2951 ," The Île-de-France tramways (French: Tramways d'Île-de-France) consists of a network of modern tram lines in the Île-de-France region of France. Ten lines are currently operational (counting Lines 3a and 3b as separate lines), with extensions and additional lines in the planning and construction stage. Although the system mainly runs in the suburban regions of Paris, lines T3a and T3b run entirely within Paris city limits, and line T2 also does so for part of its route. While the lines operate independently of each other and are generally unconnected, some connections do exist: between lines T2 and T3a (at the Porte de Versailles station, since 2009), T3a and T3b (at the Porte de Vincennes station, since 2012), T1 and T5 (at the Marché de Saint-Denis station, since 2013), T1 and T8 (at the Saint-Denis train station, since 2014) and T8 and T11 Express (at two stations : Villetaneuse-Université and Épinay-sur-Seine, since 2009). However, the final design of the entire planned tram network is fairly integrated.
Almost all lines (Lines 4 & 11 Express being the sole exceptions) are operated by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP), which also operates the Paris Métro and most bus services in the Paris immediate area. Furthermore, while most lines use conventional steel-wheel rolling stock, two lines (T5 and T6) use rubber-tired trams. Moreover, line T4, which uses tram-train technology, is operated by the French national rail operator SNCF as part of its Transilien regional rail network. Line T11 Express, which also uses tram-train technology, is operated by SNCF's subsubsidiary Transkeo. "

It took place on the weekend of 1–3 June 2012 at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain. The three classes of motorcycle racing which took place during the weekend were MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3.
Casey Stoner qualified on pole position in MotoGP, but it was his Repsol Honda teammate, Dani Pedrosa, who started in fifth place that took the lead at the first corner. Ben Spies was in second place for the first three laps, but slid off the track when challenging for the lead. This allowed the other factory Yamaha rider and championship leader Jorge Lorenzo to move up into second place and engage in a race long battle for the win with Pedrosa. Meanwhile, Stoner was behind the Tech 3 Yamaha of Andrea Dovizioso, and was battling with the other of Cal Crutchlow. He eventually beat Crutchlow to take fourth place whilst Dovizioso took the first podium of the year for the Tech 3 Yamaha team. As a consequence of the race, Lorenzo increased his lead in the riders' standings to 20 points over Stoner. Pedrosa remained third in the standings, with 30 fewer points than Lorenzo.
In Moto2, Marc Márquez took his fourth consecutive pole position by beating championship leader and fellow Spaniard Pol Espargaró by two-tenths of a second. Thomas Lüthi completed the front row with Andrea Iannone in fourth place; it was these four riders who dominated the race, staying in close company for the majority of it too. Iannone led almost every lap to take the victory, but had to resist pressure in the closing laps to take his first win of the season. Lüthi finished second and Márquez finished third after winning an appeal against a one-minute penalty issued by the FIM for a collision between himself and Espargaró, which had resulted in retirement of the Kalex rider with three laps remaining. The result rearranged the order in the riders' standings with Lüthi now leading the way on 88 points with Márquez only 2 behind. Not far behind them were Espargaró and Iannone, still firmly in contention, on 71 and 70 points respectively, the reduced gap down to the Italian's victory.
The Moto3 race was not as close as the one in the other two categories as Maverick Viñales won his home race from pole position. It was his second victory of the season. Zulfahmi Khairuddin's first front-row for any Malaysian rider, second place, failed to translate into a great result and he finished down in eighth. It was a close eighth though, as he and the six riders in front of him had squabbled in close proximity for the majority of the race allowing Viñales to break away. Sandro Cortese and Miguel Oliveira emerged victorious in the tight battle to the line to take second and third place to complete the podium. Álex Márquez set the fastest lap of the race. As a consequence of the race, Cortese was still leading the riders' standings on 87 points but, with victory, Viñales was now just 7 points behind him. Luis Salom remained third in the standings, but was now on a fairly distant 55 points, 32 fewer than Cortese. "
