Welcome to PyATE's documentation!
=================================

PyATE stands for PYthon Automated Term Extraction and is a Python implementation of term extraction algorithms such as C-Value, Basic, Combo Basic, Weirdness and Term Extractor using spaCy POS tagging.

If you have a suggestion for another ATE algorithm you would like implemented in this package feel free to file it as an issue with the paper the algorithm is based on.

For ATE packages implemented in Scala and Java, see `ATR4S <https://github.com/ispras/atr4s>`_ and `JATE <https://github.com/ziqizhang/jate>`_, respectively.
